<h3 id="c2">Prologue</h3>
<p>The U.S. government established
Charlestown Navy Yard as the newly-formed
republic was meeting early challenges
to its merchant shipping. In the
decade after gaining independence, the
young nation kept no standing navy. But
continuing raids on U.S. commerce by
Barbary pirates and French privateers in
the 1790s spurred Congress to authorize
the construction of new warships.</p>
<p>Realizing that existing private shipyards
were inadequate for the increasingly
ambitious shipbuilding program,
the Secretary of the Navy established
in 1800-1801 six federal yards to build,
outfit, repair, and supply naval vessels.
These facilities at Portsmouth, N.H.;
Boston; New York; Philadelphia;
Washington, D.C.; and Norfolk, Va.,
were the nucleus of the naval shipyard
system. Except during the Civil War,
they launched most of the Navy&rsquo;s vessels
until the advent of steel hulls in the
1880s, when private yards began building
them in greater numbers.</p>
<p>As with the first six, later naval shipyards
were sometimes created to fill an
immediate military need. The War of
1812, for instance, prompted the building
of the two Great Lakes yards. The
Mound City yard was established during
the Civil War, strategically located
near the confluence of the Mississippi
and Ohio Rivers to build and repair
Union gunboats. Although U.S. naval
vessels are today built in private shipyards,
four navy yards still actively
serve the fleet.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c3">Growth of the Yard</h3>
<p>When Captain William Bainbridge arrived
in Boston aboard U.S.S. (United States
Ship) <i>Constitution</i> in February 1813, he
had reason to be satisfied. While the U.S.
Army faltered early in the War of 1812, a
string of naval victories over British ships
was boosting public confidence. Two
months earlier, the big frigate commanded
by Bainbridge had engaged H.M.S. (His
Majesty&rsquo;s Ship) <i>Java</i> off the coast of
Brazil. <i>Java</i> was the faster ship, but <i>Constitution</i>
had heavier guns. By skillful maneuvering.
<i>Constitution</i> kept them trained on
the British frigate, pounding <i>Java</i> with
broadsides until its colors came down.</p>
<p>Crew and commander were met with
parades in Boston, but Bainbridge had little
time to enjoy the acclaim. He was
immediately faced with a task that, if not
as exciting as a sea battle, was nevertheless
formidable. He had temporarily relinquished
command of the Charlestown
Navy Yard when he sailed on <i>Constitution</i>.
While he was gone, Navy Secretary Paul
Hamilton charged the yard with building
one of the nation&rsquo;s first ships-of-the-line&mdash;the
battleships of their day. As things now
stood, that was an impossibility: Charlestown
simply lacked the facilities for such
an undertaking.</p>
<p>Bainbridge, who at 37 had already seen
extensive naval action and been imprisoned
by Barbary pirates, wrote soon after
becoming commandant in 1812: &ldquo;No period
of my naval life has been more industrious
or fatiguing.&rdquo; He was shorthanded and
hampered by bad weather, conditions that
must have sorely tested the endurance of a
man with his temperament: aggressive,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
volatile, not noted for his patience. When
he took command of the Charlestown
yard, Bainbridge pressed the Washington
bureaucracy to authorize improvements to
a facility that suffered, in his words, from
&ldquo;mismanagement and neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i07.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="801" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Captain William Bainbridge
was the Charlestown yard&rsquo;s
second commandant (1812-15)
and captain of the first
ship built there, U.S.S.</i> Independence.</p>
</div>
<p>Years later, Bainbridge was typically
blunt in depicting for the Secretary of the
Navy what he saw as the Herculean task
assigned him in 1812. The yard had been
&ldquo;in a state of perfect chaos. The public
property in a state of ruin and decay ... a
boat could not approach at certain periods
of the tide within five hundred feet of the
shore ... it was even exposed to the inroads
of the cattle from [the] highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even allowing for Bainbridge&rsquo;s penchant
for the dramatic, his description was accurate.
The buildings were too few, too
small, and in need of repair. The timber
needed to complete the repair of the
frigate <i>Chesapeake</i> was decayed beyond
use. But most pressing was the need for a
large stone wharf and building slip. Here
was a naval shipyard that could not service
a sloop-of-war, let alone build a large
frigate or ship-of-the-line. Small vessels
could tie up at the modest wooden wharf,
but the yard had to rent private wharves
for repairing warships. <i>Chesapeake</i> had
been languishing since 1809 in a rented
berth at $1500 a year.</p>
<p>The commandant&rsquo;s hilltop house surveyed
25 acres of scattered buildings and
grassy tidal flats directly across the
&ldquo;stream&rdquo; (the Charles River) from Boston.
There was a marine barracks, a
parade ground, carpenter and blacksmith
shops, a timber shed, a small hospital, a
saltwater timber dock, and piles of cannon,
shot, iron, and ballast. The facility
Bainbridge took over in 1812 was in truth
more supply depot than shipyard.</p>
<p>So why, after his exploits aboard <i>Constitution</i>,
when another ship command and
the chance for further glory were his for
the asking, did Bainbridge return to
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Charlestown? Because he had also asked
to command the powerful 74-gun ship-of-the-line
the yard would build, and he
wanted to oversee construction.</p>
<p>On resuming command in March 1813
he lobbied again for a wharf and building
slip. As a well-known ship&rsquo;s captain he
was used to getting the attention of the
Navy Department. But his sphere of
activity had shifted from quarterdeck to
desktop, and he had to watch coveted
funds go to ships bound for sea. He was
not, however, one to hold his tongue. He
bombarded the Secretary of the Navy
with letters (the tone of which, in this and
other matters, sometimes bordered on
sarcasm) until the wharf and slip were
finally begun in April 1813. After the laying
of the 74&rsquo;s keel in May, Bainbridge
was relentless in his requests for more
improvements&mdash;a navy store, capstans for
hauling out ships, &ldquo;shears&rdquo; (a simple
crane) for installing masts, a ropewalk.</p>
<p>But his real passion was the great ship
he could watch taking shape from his
window. He even suggested the name:
<i>Independence</i>. Bainbridge chafed to &ldquo;give
John Bull an opportunity of testing the
strength of an American 74&rdquo;&mdash;especially
after <i>Chesapeake</i> had finally left the yard
in June only to be captured practically
within sight of Boston by the British
frigate <i>Shannon</i>.</p>
<p>The combative commandant was rarely
put off by obstacles&mdash;or someone else&rsquo;s
reputation. Having clashed with workers
over compensation they demanded for
days lost to bad weather, he shut out the
source of trouble by ordering a shiphouse
210 feet long and 50 feet high built over
the 74&rsquo;s building slip. To oversee ship
construction Bainbridge hired Edmund
Hartt and his son Edward&mdash;well-regarded
Boston shipbuilders in whose yard was
built the hugely successful <i>Constitution</i>.
But in a dispute with Edward Hartt the
angry Bainbridge grabbed him &ldquo;by the
shoulder and carried him out of my
office.&rdquo; Hartt&rsquo;s father quit in protest,
whereupon Bainbridge quickly engaged
another shipbuilder to finish the job.</p>
<p>Bainbridge&rsquo;s other main duty as commander
of the yard was the defense of
Boston Harbor&mdash;the importance of
which was underscored by the <i>Shannon-Chesapeake</i>
engagement. By spring of
1814 British warships were raiding the
New England coast almost at will, and
the Boston citizenry (many of whom vigorously
opposed the war) was anxious
over an anticipated attack on the city.
The rising 74, Bainbridge knew, made a
tempting target while it was unarmed and
immobile on the ways. He asked for the
New England Guards, a Boston militia
company, to stand ready at the yard as
<i>Independence</i> neared completion.</p>
<p>Guarding United States property at the
Charlestown yard was normally the responsibility
of the U.S. Marines, stationed
there since 1802. But it was a small
detachment, not enough to defend the
yard and its ships against a serious attack.
Bainbridge, who earlier protested the
vulnerability of the yard, had other problems
with the marines. Though they were
under naval command while at sea, on
shore the Navy had no authority over
them. Bainbridge deplored this situation,
complaining that his inability to mete out
the same corporal punishment to marines
as was used on sailors was &ldquo;productive of
insubordination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In any case <i>Independence</i> was ready for
launching by June 1814. But the much-anticipated
ceremony on the 18th was an
embarrassing failure. <i>Independence</i> hung
up halfway down the launching ways,
much to the satisfaction of a Federalist
quoted in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>: &ldquo;It was no
wonder she stuck ... the war itself sticks.&rdquo;
The next day, when workers attempted
to move the vessel by winch with the
New England Guards pitching in to haul
on the lines, a block flew apart and killed
master joiner William Champney.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>U.S.S.</i> <span class="norm">Independence</span>, <i>built at

nation&rsquo;s first ship-of-the-line.

Brazil and Pacific squadrons.

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Then, to worsen an already grim situation,
the British warships that had blockaded
Boston Harbor for over a year
became an immediate threat. A raiding
party from the frigate <i>Nymphe</i> rowed
into the harbor in the early morning
darkness of the 21st and burned a small
sloop within a mile of the yard. The next
day, with the charred remains of the vessel
tied up at a Charlestown wharf, the
leader of the raid publicly taunted Bainbridge.
In an open letter in the <i>Boston
Patriot</i>, Bainbridge was warned to better
defend his &ldquo;unfledged Independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 22, under the
eye of the Guards, the vessel finally slid
down the ways into Boston Harbor. The
launching was celebrated by a gun salute
from <i>Constitution</i> and cheers from a
crowd of 20,000. Bainbridge&rsquo;s friend, the
author Washington Irving, couldn&rsquo;t
attend but wrote Bainbridge that he
would drink a &ldquo;potation bottle ... to the
success of your first cruise.&rdquo; In the same
spirit Bainbridge entertained with food
and drink 300 mechanics and laborers
who had, he said, &ldquo;worked cheap, and
done their work most faithfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the war he wanted so badly to join
remained out of Bainbridge&rsquo;s reach.
Desertions, along with financial and outfitting
delays, held up the vessel until
1815, by which time peace with England
had been concluded.</p>
<p>Another opportunity soon presented
itself. The predatory corsairs of the North
African Barbary States&mdash;Tunisia, Tripolitania,
Algeria, and Morocco&mdash;had long
been a thorn in the side of American
merchant shipping. Bainbridge, with
<i>Independence</i> as his flagship, won command
of a squadron whose mission was
to display to the Barbaries the new power
of the U.S. Navy. The assignment was
particularly attractive to Bainbridge, who
earlier in his career had surrendered a
ship to the Tripolitans and had another
commandeered by the Algerians. But a
second squadron under Captain Stephen
Decatur beat Bainbridge across the
Atlantic and defeated the Algerians in
battle. His role was thus reduced to persuading
the other Barbaries at gunpoint
to end their extortionist ways. The suppression
of the Barbary pirates was nevertheless
satisfying to Bainbridge. As
senior officer, he had the honor of commanding
the squadron that initiated a
permanent U.S. presence in the Mediterranean&mdash;the
first of the Navy&rsquo;s &ldquo;distant
station&rdquo; squadrons.</p>
<p>Upon Bainbridge&rsquo;s return to Boston he
attempted to regain command of the yard
from his replacement, Captain Isaac Hull.
Unsuccessful, he was instead appointed
Port Captain (&ldquo;commander afloat&rdquo; of all
naval vessels in Boston Harbor), with
<i>Independence</i> designated station flagship.
Bainbridge settled down to a career as a
senior officer, serving as commandant at
the yard twice more in the 1820s and &rsquo;30s.
He had helped put Charlestown on the
map as the builder of a major warship.
More significantly, after the War of 1812
the yard began building a reputation as
an important repair and supply facility.</p>
<p class="tb">The Charlestown yard, and the U.S. Navy
itself, owed their existence in part to the
same Barbary pirates who occasioned
<i>Independence&rsquo;s</i> first cruise. The severing
of ties with Britain during the Revolution
also meant the loss of protection from the
Barbaries long provided by the Mother
Country&rsquo;s powerful navy and by the
&ldquo;tribute&rdquo; Britain paid them. The United
States had no navy to protect its seaborne
commerce&mdash;so essential to a coastal
nation dependent on overseas trade&mdash;and
the treasury could not bear the tribute
payments or the ransom demands for
captured ships and sailors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Thus after independence the Mediterranean
trade had been virtually closed to
the United States. There was much unresolved
debate about the problem, but
when the pirates spilled out into the
Atlantic in 1793 and took 11 American
vessels in a few months, Congress took
action. The following year it authorized
six frigates, three of which were launched
in 1797: <i>United States</i>, <i>Constellation</i>, and
<i>Constitution</i>.</p>
<p>Congress was spurred to finish the job
by the actions of Revolutionary France
during its war with Britain. French commerce
raiders so terrorized American
neutral shipping that in 1798 an angry
U.S. government created the Navy Department
and prepared for war. (There
were a number of engagements at sea,
but war was never declared.) Congress
authorized funds to build, borrow, or
accept as gifts 49 vessels, ranging from
galleys to six 74-gun ships-of-the-line.</p>
<p>The 74s were never built, but while the
program was still alive, naval shipyards to
build them were established in Portsmouth,
Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, and Norfolk. Boston, wrote
Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert
to President John Adams, from &ldquo;the natural
strength of its situation [meaning its
large, deep, and defensible harbor], the
great number of ship carpenters in its
vicinity, and of its seamen, must always
remain a building place and place of rendezvous
for our navy of the first importance.&rdquo;
Thus in 1800 the Charlestown
Navy Yard was established.</p>
<p>For most of its history Charlestown&rsquo;s
primary mission was to keep the fleet sailing.
That is not to say the yard wasn&rsquo;t a
shipbuilder; it built more than 200 warships
over its 174 years of operation. But
most of the new ships were built to meet
the immediate demands of war. (Three
quarters of them were launched during
World War II alone.) For fully half of
those years no new ships came down the
ways. The pattern established in the
yard&rsquo;s early years was one of ongoing
repair, outfitting, supply, and conversion
work punctuated by occasional new
launchings.</p>
<p>The classes of ships that came down the
ways at Charlestown and other naval
yards were the outcome of strategic and
political deliberations in Washington.
U.S. naval policy devised during the first
half of the 19th century had its roots in
the War of 1812. Before the British
blockade bottled up its warships, the tiny
U.S. Navy had successfully fought a brief
<i>guerre de course</i> against Britain, using a
strategy that emphasized single ship
actions and raids on enemy shipping with
relatively small, fast frigates and sloops-of-war.
The early naval successes prompted
Congress in 1813 to authorize six new
frigates (three of which were built) and
six sloops. These, and the nine frigates
authorized in 1816 and laid down in the
1820s (including the Charlestown-built
<i>Cumberland</i>), formed the backbone of
the Navy until just before the Civil War.</p>
<p>But the War of 1812, which helped
shape a practical role for the 19th-century
Navy, also led lawmakers into an expensive
attempt to compete with European
navies on their terms. Using the argument
that large, powerful ships were
essential to the defense of the nation&rsquo;s
shores (and perhaps remembering the
crucial role of French 74s at Yorktown),
Congress also authorized four 74-gun
ships-of-the-line in the 1813 act.</p>
<p>While ships-of-the-line were traditionally
used in fleet actions with set lines of
battle (hence their name), they were also
deployed to break blockades and to
&ldquo;show the flag&rdquo;&mdash;that is, remind other
nations of the United States&rsquo; military
reach. Postwar nationalism, a popular
navy still basking in the nation&rsquo;s praise,
and the country&rsquo;s demonstrated vulnerability
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
to blockade prompted appropriations
in 1816 for additional 74s.</p>
<p>Between 1813 and 1822 fourteen 74s
were laid down, including <i>Independence</i>
(1813), <i>Vermont</i> (1818), and <i>Virginia</i>
(1822) at Charlestown. But in the decade
after the war strategists cast a skeptical
eye on such large ships. The expensive,
provocative, and easily outmaneuvered
behemoths, they said, were only a drag
on the Navy&mdash;inappropriate for a young
nation that wanted to stay out of European
conflicts. By 1825 only five 74s had
gone into service.</p>
<p>In 1835 <i>Independence</i> took a turn in its
career that was emblematic of naval policy.
The 74 had lain idle at Charlestown
for 13 years. It was a sluggish sailer, and
its great weight and design flaws brought
the lower lee guns too close to the water
to be useful during combat. So <i>Independence</i>
was &ldquo;razeed,&rdquo; cut down from three
decks to two, and transformed from an
unsuccessful ship-of-the-line into a very
good 54-gun frigate&mdash;the largest and one
of the fastest in the Navy.</p>
<p>Only a few present at its 1837 recommissioning
realized that <i>Independence</i>
was also among the last of its kind. Fast
approaching was a technology that would
displace naval sail; steam would drive the
Navy of the future. In 1839 the Navy&rsquo;s
first commissioned steamer&mdash;the two-year-old
harbor battery <i>Fulton II</i>&mdash;arrived
at Charlestown for repairs. A
local paper called it &ldquo;the oddest looking
fish we have ever set our eyes on.&rdquo; Four
towering stacks spouting black smoke
rose from the deck, on which were
mounted engine cylinders four feet in
diameter. The sidewheel covers, likened
to &ldquo;immense fungi,&rdquo; barely cleared the
sides of the dry dock.</p>
<p class="tb">With the dock and other improvements,
the Charlestown yard had by the 1840s
taken shape as an important repair and
shipbuilding facility. The dry dock (<i>see
pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_40">40</a>-41</i>), five years abuilding, had
opened in 1833 amid much ceremony.
Vice President Martin Van Buren and
other dignitaries watched as the already-venerable
<i>Constitution</i>, stripped and
demasted, inaugurated the dock. Much of
the tidal flats had been reclaimed behind
a granite quay (the yard would triple its
original size by 1869), and the rest of the
yard&rsquo;s uneven grounds had been leveled.
A high stone wall, built to help stop pilfering
and protect the ships, stretched
between the Charles and Mystic rivers.</p>
<p>The yard had become more self-sufficient.
The boilers for the dry dock pump
engines also provided steam for the new
sawmill and blockmaking and armorer&rsquo;s
shops. In 1837, the yard&rsquo;s ropewalk (also
steam-powered) and tar house had been
completed (<i>see pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_20">20</a>-21</i>). The yard
now made its own paint in the &ldquo;oil
house,&rdquo; while hardware was supplied by a
large smithy with 12 forges.</p>
<p>Other significant additions: masting
shears looming over the new shear wharf;
a sparmaker&rsquo;s shed, masthouse, and sail
loft; new timber docks; a steam chest for
bending wood; an armory with thousands
of muskets, bayonets, and swords; and
neat ranks of guns, shot, and anchors in
their respective &ldquo;parks.&rdquo; Hundreds of elm
trees planted by order of Commodore
Bainbridge softened the yard&rsquo;s industrial
setting.</p>
<p>Anchored out in the harbor were several
vessels &ldquo;in ordinary.&rdquo; A vessel in ordinary
was out of service and in storage
with a skeleton crew until recommissioned.
The ship was demasted, salted to
retard dry rot, whitewashed inside, tightly
caulked, and its sides and decks &ldquo;payed&rdquo;
with a thick coat of varnish and tar. Tubular
windsails directing air belowdecks and
holes cut in the bulkheads insured good
air circulation. Some vessels in ordinary at
Charlestown had protective wood and
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
canvas sheds over their decks, an innovation
of Captain Hull.</p>
<p><i>Vermont</i>, <i>Virginia</i>, and the frigate <i>Cumberland</i>,
begun in 1825, had become permanent
fixtures in their great shiphouses.
They were still officially under construction
and near completion, but were really
in ordinary. (<i>Virginia</i> was something of
an ill-starred vessel. Over the years at
least three people had died in accidents
around the ship, and its reputation was
reconfirmed in 1845 when a visitor fell to
his death from its scaffolding.) Construction
on <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Vermont</i> had slowed
to a standstill after critics questioned the
strategic value of ships-of-the-line. But
economic considerations played at least
as big a role; ordinary was a cheap way to
keep expensive-to-sail vessels, including
big frigates like <i>Cumberland</i> (launched in
1842), ready for war.</p>
<p>In 1848 <i>Vermont</i> was finally launched to
&ldquo;a vast concourse of people and the firing
of cannons.&rdquo; But the day of the big 74s
was over. Neither <i>Vermont</i> nor <i>New
Hampshire</i> (built at Portsmouth Navy
Yard), the last two ships-of-the-line completed
by the Navy, ever saw service as a
commissioned warship. In fact most 74s
had short careers of little strategic consequence.
<i>Independence</i>, first of the class,
was the only one still serving as a warship
at mid-century, but it had been cut down
to a frigate.</p>
<p>The launching of <i>Vermont</i> also closed a
chapter in the yard&rsquo;s history. The second
ship laid down at Charlestown 30 years
before, <i>Vermont</i> was the last all sail-powered
warship launched there&mdash;obsolescent
even as it came down the ways.</p>
<p class="tb">Although this was a U.S. Navy Yard run
by naval officers, throughout its history
those wielding the caulking mallets and
rivet guns were civilians working for civilian
foremen. During the first half of the
19th century the yard&rsquo;s workforce steadily
increased from 89 in 1822 to 370 in 1853.
At mid-century the records show most of
them were born in New England&mdash;half
from Massachusetts. Some 15 percent were
Irish, the majority working as laborers.</p>
<p>So complicated an undertaking as the
building of a warship required an array of
specialized occupations falling under the
general label of &ldquo;mechanics&rdquo;: carpenters,
sawyers, joiners, sparmakers, blockmakers,
painters, gun carriage makers, armorers,
sailmakers, blacksmiths, caulkers, riggers,
boatbuilders, coopers, ropemakers,
masons, machinists, plumbers, and coppersmiths.
A force of unskilled laborers was at
times supplemented by the ordinary crews
and by the sailors stationed at the yard.</p>
<p>Each shop had its master, quartermen
(leaders of several crews), leadingmen
(crew leaders), and crews of mechanics,
apprentices, laborers, and a few boys
(before child labor laws eliminated such
positions). In the early years, when the
yard&rsquo;s facilities were sparse, it was not
unusual for the master to have his own
shop outside of the yard. The commandant
would in effect contract with the master to
do the work there with his own men. In the
1840s and &rsquo;50s the Navy tightened the regulations,
giving the masters less leeway in
hiring and ordering supplies. By the Civil
War they were all yard employees.</p>
<p>A look at the young men in the apprenticeship
program, started in 1817, gives a
clearer picture of the yard employees they
would become. Those applying for the program&mdash;generally
at age 16&mdash;had to show
good character and be physically able to
perform the tasks of their trade. They had
to demonstrate the ability to read, write,
and do simple math. The terms of the five-year
indenture (later reduced to four) were
generally clear: in return for exhibiting
growing mastery of his trade, the apprentice
received from the Navy room and
board, increasing pay, and continuing education
in reading, writing, arithmetic, and
theories of the trade. But because the
indenture was technically a personal contract
between the boy&rsquo;s parents or
guardian and the master, not the Navy,
questions of obligation sometimes arose
when a new man became master. At the
end of the apprenticeship&mdash;usually at age
21&mdash;the boy became a yard employee.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Navy Yard Tradesmen in the Age of Sail</h4>
<p>During the early 19th century,
Charlestown&rsquo;s shipyard bell
called several hundred civilian
tradesmen and laborers to
work each morning. Laboring
from sunrise to sunset under
the supervision of naval officers
and civilian shop masters,
these yard employees built,
repaired, and supplied United
States warships for naval duty
around the globe. Fluctuating
government budgets, changing
seasons, and the uneven
demands of war and peace
made navy yard work intermittent
and unpredictable.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h4 class="interlude">The Ropewalk</h4>
<p>Several factors enticed the U.S. Navy into constructing its only ropemaking facility at the
Charlestown Navy Yard in the 1830s: skilled labor, access to raw materials, and technical
expertise. The port of Boston already boasted more than a dozen ropewalks employing
many skilled artisans. Perhaps most importantly, the Navy was eager to take
advantage of newly developed labor-saving machines like those already in use in
New England&rsquo;s textile mills. Because rope had to be twisted in a straight line, the maximum
length that could be produced was determined by the length of the ropewalk (so
called because workers spinning the hemp fibers by hand walked the length of the
building). The Charlestown ropewalk&rsquo;s quarter-mile length allowed production of
rope up to 1200 feet long. Designed by architect Alexander Parris (best known for
Boston&rsquo;s Quincy Market), the ropewalk complex included the rope &ldquo;laying&rdquo; area running
the length of the building, spinning and preparing machine rooms, the hemp
house, and the tar house. The complex was powered by massive steam engines and
tended by men and boys. The Navy&rsquo;s move to mechanized rope production came at a
critical time, as machine-spun rope began to replace intricate hand-spinning techniques.
The hand spinners&rsquo; resistance inspired contests in the 1840s, in which they
challenged the quality of machine-made rope. The results of such a challenge to
the Charlestown ropewalk were somewhat ironic. Though its machine-made
rope proved to be stronger and cheaper to produce, hand-spun rope was superior
in the smaller sizes, and the mechanized ropewalk began producing some hand-spun
rope, doing so until the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>Budget-minded Naval Commissioners
in Washington allowed the commandant
to pay just enough to hold on to his workers.
He generally matched the rates of
private shipyards in the area to keep
workers from being lured away. The daily
rates thus fell with the coming of cold
weather and the slowing of work, since
the workers were then in low demand
elsewhere. The Navy defended this hard-nosed
practice, maintaining that with
fewer daylight hours (workers mustered
at sunrise and were dismissed at sunset),
the yard got less work out of the men.
The niggardly pay policies sometimes
backfired: in 1821 the low-paid sailmakers
left en masse to work at private yards.</p>
<p>More than the skilled craftsmen, the
laborers&rsquo; jobs depended on the amount
of work at the yard, but most of the
workforce awaited the coming of cold
weather with some anxiety. The yard&rsquo;s
practice was to retain only as many people
as it could keep working, and bad
weather sharply reduced the volume of
work. The completion of a new ship or of
a major repair job also meant the letting
go of large numbers of workers, at least
until the next job. In effect many in the
workforce were not given permanent
jobs, but only hired on to perform seasonal
work, much like house carpenters,
or to complete a single project.</p>
<p>Though the situation was normally
weighted in favor of the employer, the
scales could occasionally tip the other
way, especially for skilled workers. In
1825, when the coming of spring coincided
with a surge in building brought on by
a recent Boston fire, Commandant William
Crane was forced to raise wages to compete
for skilled workers. He sent his Master
Builder Josiah Barker up the coast as
far as Portland to recruit mechanics.</p>
<p>At times skilled workers attempted to
force the Navy&rsquo;s hand, organizing to protest
conditions. When the caulkers struck
for higher wages in January 1835, the commandant,
Commodore Jesse Elliott, fired
them and quickly found others willing to
work at the established rate. Two days later
the &ldquo;refractory caulkers,&rdquo; unable to find
work in the middle of the winter, asked to
be rehired at their old wages. Wanting to
remain on good terms with his employees,
Elliott allowed the men to return.</p>
<p>Sometimes the walkout worked. Yard
workers considered unreasonable a change
in their working hours made in 1852. By
this time they were working a straight 10-hour
day. But under the new policy, they
had to work sunrise to sunset if that period
contained even a minute less than 11
hours, thus adding up to an hour to their
day during the winter. They walked off the
job, forcing the Navy to rescind the policy.</p>
<p>These actions represent a period when
the yard workers, though not yet unionized,
could strike&mdash;an option later denied
to government employees. While workers
were generally forced to accept the prevailing
pay and conditions at the yard, they
were not completely without power.</p>
<p>In the Charlestown Navy Yard&rsquo;s first
half-century, world events, U.S. politics,
and sectional rivalries affected the ebb and
flow of work and the hiring and firing of
men. The yard was born in the midst of a
world at war and grew to prominence in a
time of relative calm&mdash;in retrospect, the
lull before the storm of civil war.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Building a Wooden Ship</h4>
<p>The creation of a wooden
warship began in the mold
loft. There carpenters translated
specifications from
standard plans for each class
of vessel into full-sized wooden
patterns. These were used
to fashion hull members, for
which white oak or live oak
were the favored woods.
(Some 2,000 trees were
required for a 74-gun ship-of-the-line.)
On the slightly
inclined building ways, joiners
first laid the keel, the great
spine of the ship running
along the bottom of the hull.
Then they attached the stem
and the stern post to the keel
and raised the frames&mdash;the
vessel&rsquo;s ribs. The frames
formed the contours of the
hull and, together with horizontal
deck beams and vertical
stanchions beneath the
beams, provided a strong
skeleton. After 1829, iron and
copper bolts and spikes
replaced many of the wooden
&ldquo;treenails&rdquo; that secured the
structural members and fastened
the deck and hull planking.
The rudder was hung, the
hull caulked and sheathed
with copper to protect it from
teredo worms, and the ship
was launched. Riggers then
&ldquo;stepped&rdquo; masts to the keelson,
a lengthwise beam bolted
to the keel (<i>see <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a></i>).
After they rigged the horizontal
spars, cordage, and sails,
the new warship was ready
for outfitting.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Frigate <i>Constitution</i></h4>
<p>The first three warships ordered for the infant U.S. Navy
in 1794&mdash;one of them the Boston-built <i>Constitution</i>&mdash;were
frigates unlike any others. Naval strategists knew
the nation could afford to build only a few vessels, so
they had to be formidable warships. They were inspired
by French &ldquo;razees,&rdquo; ships-of-the-line (<i>see <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a></i>) that had
one gun deck removed, transforming them into large, heavily armed frigates. The sharp
lines of <i>Constitution&rsquo;s</i> hull gave it a frigate&rsquo;s speed, but
in size and stoutness it was comparable to a small ship-of-the-line. (Its heavy oak
frames, spaced close together and sheathed with thick planking, proved virtually
impenetrable in battle&mdash;hence the name &ldquo;Old Ironsides.&rdquo;)
The theory was that <i>Constitution</i> would be powerful enough to fight any frigate,
quick enough to flee anything bigger. The British, though, scorned the new frigates,
asserting that they lacked the tactical strengths of either frigates or
ships-of-the-line: too slow to engage the former, too weak to stand up to
the latter. But <i>Constitution</i> more than lived up to U.S. expectations
in the War of 1812, when it bested two British frigates in separate
battles, escaped two more, and captured a frigate and a sloop-of-war in a third
engagement. <i>Constitution</i> fought no more battles, but served honorably for another
40 years. Throughout its career <i>Constitution</i> has been
closely associated with the Charlestown Navy Yard,
undergoing several overhauls there. The first was in 1833,
when the frigate inaugurated the yard&rsquo;s dry dock. In 1992-95
it was serviced in the same dock. Since 1897 the
yard has been home port for <i>Constitution</i>, the Navy&rsquo;s oldest
commissioned warship.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Sinking of Union sloop</i> Cumberland <i>by Confederate ironclad</i> Virginia
(<i>ex-U.S.S.</i> Merrimack) <i>in 1862, by Alexander C. Stuart</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h3 id="c4">The Coming of Iron and Steam</h3>
<p><i>Merrimack</i>, <i>Virginia</i>, <i>Cumberland</i>: names
that point up the ironies of war. As the
steam frigate <i>Merrimack</i> was being
launched in July 1855 (<i>see pages <a href="#Page_32">32-33</a></i>),
the partially built ship-of-the-line <i>Virginia</i>
lay in another part of the yard. It had been
laid down and named in the 1820s, a more
harmonious time. Even if the old 74 had
finally come down the ways, it is not likely
that, amidst the sectional acrimony of the
1850s, it would have kept the old name&mdash;and
certainly not after the secession of the
state whose namesake it was.</p>
<p>A year after <i>Merrimack&rsquo;s</i> launching, the
frigate was back in the yard after going
aground during its shakedown cruise
(when the crew becomes familiar with a
ship and problems are ironed out). While
workers replaced damaged coppering and
repaired the propeller on the big warship,
a smaller sail frigate waited its turn.</p>
<p>Launched 13 years earlier, <i>Cumberland</i>
had served as flagship of the African
Squadron, whose mission was to suppress
slave running. Now back home, <i>Cumberland</i>
moved into the dry dock soon after
<i>Merrimack</i> was towed out. It was cut down
to a fast sloop-of-war with one gun deck of
28 guns and a crew of 376.</p>
<p><i>Cumberland&rsquo;s</i> worth as a leaner warship
was proven in the first months of the Civil
War. Assigned to the Atlantic Blockading
Squadron, the vessel took eight Confederate
prizes in three weeks. But the next
year <i>Cumberland</i>, among the last sailing
ships launched by the Navy, came up hard
against the future.</p>
<p>On March 8, 1862, <i>Cumberland</i> and other
vessels were on blockade duty in Hampton
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Roads, Virginia, when the men on
deck sighted a bizarre new war machine
steaming out of Norfolk. Approaching
them was a dark, monolithic vessel&mdash;decks
awash, no masts, no sails, no sailors. C.S.S.
(Confederate States Ship) <i>Virginia</i>, the
much-rumored ironclad blockade-breaker,
had finally taken the stage.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i15.jpg" alt="" width="342" height="799" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Architect&rsquo;s rendering of the Charlestown machine shop&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Great Chimney,&rdquo; 1858.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It was a slow, clumsy vessel, but menacing
nevertheless. Using a full mile to gather
momentum, <i>Virginia</i> steamed steadily
towards the Union vessels. It passed the
frigate <i>Congress</i> and headed straight for
<i>Cumberland</i>, its sloping iron casement
shedding the Union ships&rsquo; barrage of
heavy shot and explosive shell as if they
were &ldquo;peas from a pop-gun,&rdquo; in the words
of a <i>Cumberland</i> sailor. But <i>Cumberland</i>,
though clearly outmatched, could not
avoid engagement. It was at anchor in a
dead calm, the crew&rsquo;s wash drying in the
rigging. The Union sailors could only take
the punishing return fire, clear the decks
for battle, and wait for the inevitable.</p>
<p>Longer than <i>Cumberland</i> by half, with a
submerged iron ram projecting from its
bow, the approaching vessel looked to the
Union ship&rsquo;s pilot like a &ldquo;huge, half-submerged
crocodile.&rdquo; <i>Virginia</i> tore into
<i>Cumberland&rsquo;s</i> bow below the waterline
(<i>see pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_28">28</a>-29</i>), then backed off, leaving
its ram imbedded in a seven-foot hole.
Both vessels now loosed volleys at point-blank
range; dozens of <i>Cumberland&rsquo;s</i> crew
were maimed or killed.</p>
<p>As the vessel listed and began to sink,
the crew abandoned ship, but 121 men&mdash;already
dead, too hurt to save themselves,
or firing guns to the end&mdash;went down with
<i>Cumberland</i>. (As water flooded the gun
deck, a young gun crew officer barely
saved himself by squeezing through a gun-port.
He was Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge,
who in 1890 became commandant of
the Charlestown Navy Yard.) Before darkness
ended the fighting, the ironclad also
riddled <i>Congress</i>, killing more than a hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
men and setting the vessel on fire.
<i>Congress</i> burned on into the night and
finally exploded.</p>
<p>The frightening weapon that had handed
the U.S. Navy its worst defeat began its
career as the hull of a wooden steam vessel.
A week after the surrender of Fort
Sumter, the loss of the important Gosport
Navy Yard at Norfolk to rebel troops
became inevitable. Evacuating Union
forces&mdash;under cover of <i>Cumberland</i>&mdash;burned
and scuttled several warships to
keep them from falling into Confederate
hands. But some were salvageable, including
a large steam frigate on which everything
below the waterline was intact.
Southern engineers converted the vessel
into an advanced warship, removing the
masts and topping the hull with a rooflike
iron shell. The original name of the vessel
they retrieved and transformed: U.S.S.
<i>Merrimack</i>.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Merrimack&rsquo;s</i> reincarnation as <i>Virginia</i>
embodied two technologies&mdash;steam and
iron (and then steel)&mdash;that were advanced
during the Civil War and that eventually
defined the modern Navy. Steam engineering
had traveled a long road of acceptance
in the conservative Navy. By 1850,
the year the Charlestown Navy Yard built
its first steamer, Great Britain had built or
converted from sail some 25 propeller and
paddlewheel steam warships. The U.S.
Navy had launched only seven. Steam
engines were still considered novelties by
many old Navy men&mdash;at best auxiliary
power, at worst dirty and undependable
nuisances that called for machine tenders
rather than sailors.</p>
<p>Their resistance was not entirely unjustified.
There was the problem of range:
<i>Merrimack</i>, for instance, could cruise only
about 17 days with its coal bunker full.
American steamers far from home had to
depend on French or British coaling stations
and machine shops in places like
Hong Kong and Shanghai. Unlike self-reliant
sail, steam alone could not meet
the demands of distant squadrons. And in
the early days of steam, it was no faster
than sail: in fact it was often slower. More
crucial, early steam engines were inefficient
and unreliable, so captains would
not trust them in combat. And coal took
up valuable space needed for supplies,
crew, and ammunition.</p>
<p>But the main problem was that early
steamers were driven by big, ungainly
sidewheels that caused captains no end of
problems (<i>see <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a></i>). They so harmed a
vessel&rsquo;s sailing qualities that steam was of
necessity the primary power source on
sidewheelers&mdash;but the Navy wanted to
use steam only as auxiliary power.</p>
<p>Another way of employing steam power
for propulsion was needed. The propeller
(called a &ldquo;screw&rdquo;) was the answer, allowing
naval steam to come into its own.
Construction of the prototype screw sloop
<i>Princeton</i> began in 1841, before America&rsquo;s
first sidewheel warships even went
into service. The Navy built only eight
more deepwater sidewheelers before the
famous 1854 class of six screw steamers
(led by the Charlestown-built <i>Merrimack</i>)
made the cumbersome vessels a footnote
in naval history. With the advent of the
propeller, enough problems were solved
that auxiliary steam power became feasible
in warships. On an 1858 cruise from
Honolulu to Acapulco, <i>Merrimack</i>
steamed only three days out of 32.</p>
<p><i>Merrimack</i>, whose subsequent adventures
we have already followed, was in the
tradition of large American frigates like
<i>Constitution</i>. While its engines were never
very dependable, <i>Merrimack</i> was an
excellent sailer, powerfully armed, and on
its inaugural European cruise inspired
Britain to build similar vessels with better
engines.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The screw sloop <i>Hartford</i>, launched at
Charlestown in 1858, was one of a follow-up
class of steamers. (These and other
screw steamers of the &rsquo;50s were all frigates
and sloops; no steam ship-of-the-line was
built at Charlestown or any other yard. As
we have seen, the era of such large wooden
ships was over by the time the Navy was
converting to steam.) These were smaller
vessels with a shallower draft&mdash;better suited
to coastal and river operations. As Rear
Admiral David G. Farragut&rsquo;s flagship in
victories at New Orleans and Mobile Bay,
<i>Hartford</i> was perhaps the most celebrated
steamer in the Union Navy.</p>
<p>With propellers, even the most hidebound
captains could appreciate the better
maneuverability steam gave them during
combat. Gradually the tactical roles of
steam and sail were reversed, with increasingly
efficient and dependable steam
engines officially becoming the primary
power source and sail the auxiliary. As a
matter of economy, however, American
vessels continued to use sail whenever possible
on long-distance cruises.</p>
<p>Steam technology demanded a whole
new set of skills of Charlestown&rsquo;s mechanics.
When the steam battery <i>Fulton II</i>
docked there in 1839, the yard could repair
only the vessel&rsquo;s wooden components, having
to contract work on the engine to local
companies. But by 1845 yard personnel
could fully service the screw sloop <i>Princeton</i>.
While some carpenters may have
made the transition, it is more likely that
most of those working with steam machinery
had a background in the field.</p>
<p>As the yard adapted to the new age, it
underwent a decade of modernization and
quickened production preceding the Civil
War. The dry dock was lengthened; gas
lights were installed; the yard began manufacturing
wire rope in 1857. But the most
important improvement was a state-of-the-art
machine shop&mdash;its 240-foot stack long a
landmark at the yard&mdash;that replaced the
old smithery in 1859. It contained such
equipment as a machine that could plane a
metal surface 10 feet square and a huge
lathe capable of handling iron propeller
shafts 35 feet long. The facility also helped
the yard to incorporate a new technology
dramatized (though not introduced) by
C.S.S. <i>Virginia</i>: ironcladding.</p>
<p>Sinking of large warships had rarely occurred
in naval battle. Solid shot either
bounced off thick wooden hulls or left a
small, patchable hole. So warships normally
just blasted away at each other until one
of them, casualties mounting and its deck
and rigging a shambles, hauled down its
colors. Yet <i>Virginia</i> had sunk or caused to
eventually sink two of them in two hours.
Its ironcladding allowed it to get close
enough to <i>Cumberland</i> to use an ancient
but still effective technique, ramming, and
close enough to <i>Congress</i> to pound the
ship at close range with its broadside shot
and big rifles. While ramming would not
remain a tactical option, ironcladding was
universally adopted as every naval power
raced to design hulls that could withstand
ever more powerful explosive shells fired
from rifled guns (<i>see pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_42">42</a>-43</i>).</p>
<p>As in every war, technology helped
shape strategy in the Civil War and strategic
considerations helped determine how
new technologies were applied. The
Navy&rsquo;s major role in the war effort was to
blockade some 3,500 miles of Southern
coastline. The South&rsquo;s blockade runners
were typically the most advanced examples
of British shipbuilding, steam-powered
sidewheelers that were often iron- or
steel-hulled. In the first year of the war,
only about one in eleven of these runners
were caught (partly because sidewheelers
were still faster than screw steamers), and
the Union Navy continued to build, borrow,
and buy every vessel it could to
strengthen the blockade.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="small"><i>Continues on <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a></i></span></span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Steam Propulsion</h4>
<p>When steam was introduced as an auxiliary naval power
source in the 1820s, paddle-wheels were the initial method
of propulsion. In the late 1830s engineers began working with
propellers&mdash;&ldquo;screws&rdquo; in naval terminology. Each technology
had its partisans: the sidewheel provided greater combat
maneuverability, was suited to riverine warfare, and
presented no problems of leakage, as did the screw&rsquo;s
underwater shaft hole. However, the exposed wheels
were vulnerable during combat, ate up deck space needed
for guns, hindered sail handling, and created more drag
than a screw when the vessel was under sail. The launching
of the screw warships H.M.S. <i>Rattler</i> in Britain and U.S.S.
<i>Princeton</i> in the United States in 1843 signaled the coming
ascendancy of screw propulsion. In the historic 1845 tug-of-war
between <i>Rattler</i> and an otherwise-identical sidewheeler,
the greater efficiency of the screw was publicly confirmed.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Thus when naval officers learned of the
conversion of <i>Merrimack</i> into an armored
blockade-breaker, they were understandably
worried. In the debate over the type
of vessel the Navy should develop to
counter the Southern threat, John Ericsson&rsquo;s
proposal for a turreted, shallow-drafted
coastal ironclad won out over larger,
oceangoing designs with traditional
broadsides. His ironclad, called U.S.S.
<i>Monitor</i>, was the prototype of the turreted
ironclad class named after it. (While monitors
and <i>Virginia</i>-type ironclads continued
to meet the needs of a mostly coastal and
riverine naval war, two broadside ironclads
were built by the Union. One of
them, <i>New Ironsides</i>, was quite effective.)</p>
<p><i>Monitor</i> fought <i>Virginia</i> to a standoff the
day after the latter sank <i>Cumberland</i>. It
was the first clash between steam-powered
ironclads, and the world took notice. Captain
John Dahlgren, creator of <i>Monitor&rsquo;s</i>
two big guns, put it succinctly: &ldquo;Now
comes the reign of iron&mdash;and cased sloops
are to take the place of wooden ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not happen immediately: <i>Monitor</i>-class
iron hulls were not very seaworthy.
(<i>Monitor</i> sank in late 1862 while being
towed during a storm off Cape Hatteras.)
Wooden ships under both sail and steam
power continued to fight the Civil War&rsquo;s
deepwater battles, but Dahlgren&rsquo;s words
came true after the war. The evolving iron,
and then steel, warship incorporated elements
from both ironclads: the deeper hull
and superstructure of <i>Virginia</i> and, rather
than multiple-gun broadsides, a few large
guns in revolving <i>Monitor</i>-type turrets that
allowed the guns to be trained without
turning the entire vessel.</p>
<p>Only four monitors were built by navy
shipyards, but officers considered them
the best produced during the war. <i>Monadnock</i>,
a double-turreted monitor built at
Charlestown, was generally thought the
best of the lot and the only one of this
class to see action. After the war, it proved
its unusual seaworthiness by voyaging
around Cape Horn to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Other than <i>Monadnock</i>, ironcladding
work at the Charlestown yard was performed
on vessels built elsewhere,
although the workers clad with iron the
bulwarks of some of the double-ended
sidewheelers built there. These vessels, a
temporary reprieve for naval sidewheel
technology, were designed for the narrow,
shallow rivers of the South, allowing the
&ldquo;brown-water&rdquo; Navy to reverse direction
without turning around. The Charlestown
yard built five double-enders&mdash;the biggest
class constructed there during the war and,
with those built at other yards, the biggest
class of ships produced in the United
States before World War I.</p>
<p>The Charlestown yard had in 1858 initiated
its first machinist apprenticeship,
acknowledging the inevitable transformation
of the yard&rsquo;s work. Steam had somewhat
prepared the way for the yard&rsquo;s artisans
to work with iron: those already
trained as boilermakers could adapt their
skills to ironcladding. But increasingly the
trades related to steam machinery and
ironcladding were formalized with titles
and apprenticeships. Through the 1850s
and &rsquo;60s, machinists, iron moulders, and
boilermakers accounted for an increasingly
large part of the workforce: from a total
of 26 (3 percent) in 1854 to 371 (19 percent)
in 1866. But even though such trades
were necessary in the yard by the mid-1860s,
they were still in the minority and
were paid less, considered less exacting
and more easily mastered than the old
wooden ship trades.</p>
<p>Samuel Cochran, a longtime employee
at Charlestown, recalled later in life that
when he arrived at the yard as a young
man during the Civil War &ldquo;the majority of
the men employed were ship carpenters
and joiners and most of the tools they used
were cross cut saws and axes.&rdquo; His own job
was to turn the grindstone on which they
were sharpened.</p>
<p>Cochran went on to paint a vivid picture
of the yard during the war years when
some 3,000 workers held jobs there: the
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
ordnance workers who had the dangerous
job of retrieving powder from the magazine,
donning canvas slippers to reduce the
chance of sparks; the clandestine barrels of
liquor in cellars, complete with drinking
straws; the yard &ldquo;politicians&rdquo; who owed
their jobs to patronage; sawyers in their
six-foot-deep sawpits; the sailors (&ldquo;Jackies&rdquo;)
on the receiving ships finding new
ways to get extra grog on board.</p>
<p>A minor labor grievance in 1861 illustrates
how the exigencies of war changed
the working atmosphere at the yard and
reduced the workers&rsquo; leverage. As it had in
1852, the government decided that yard
employees should work sunrise to sunset
from September to March, thus bringing
their hours in line with those of private
yard workers. Again the workers protested,
although they continued to work, stating
in their petition that they had no desire
to hinder the government&rsquo;s campaign to
&ldquo;crush out a foul rebellion.&rdquo; This time the
Navy made no concessions. Two strikes in
1862 over the same issue were half-hearted
and futile; the longer hours remained in
effect.</p>
<p class="tb">The sense of urgency and focus engendered
by war and the accelerated pace of
technological change pushed the yard to
extraordinary levels of production. So it
was not surprising that with the coming of
peace the activity here and at other yards
fell off. But the drop was precipitous. At
war&rsquo;s end, in sheer numbers and in engine
technology, the U.S. fleet compared favorably
with those of the European powers.
In the weeks after Appomattox, however,
the fleet shrank dramatically and continued
to decline thereafter. In the postwar
economic and political climate, the government&rsquo;s
priorities shifted. Massive funds
were needed for reconstruction of the
southern states and for war-deferred developments
of the nation&rsquo;s interior. The
Navy would have to wait.</p>
<p>European navies, though, were riding
the new wave of technology. In the 1870s
their warships began to shed their sailing
rigs as steam power became routine technology.
But in America the old guard
reasserted itself in peace, and there was a
reaction against steam. After 1869, all
naval vessels, steam or not, were required
to have &ldquo;full sail power,&rdquo; and captains
were on notice that they would pay for
any coal they consumed other than for
emergencies. Four-bladed propellers were
replaced with two blades to reduce drag
when under sail&mdash;with a corresponding
loss of steaming efficiency.</p>
<p>As the British and European navies
rapidly converted to lighter and stronger
iron and then steel hulls on their largest
ships, virtually all U.S. vessels built in the
1860s and &rsquo;70s were wooden-hulled
(although some of these contained iron
bracing). Even as late as 1885, the <i>Army
and Navy Journal</i> asserted that &ldquo;a
staunch, fast wooden vessel is still the best
for cruising purposes.&rdquo; But while wooden-hulled
U.S. naval vessels were generally
acknowledged to be fine examples of their
kind, many were well past their prime:
<i>Independence</i>, for example, flagship of the
first Mediterranean squadron, had been a
receiving ship at Mare Island Navy Yard
in California since 1857.</p>
<p>It was not only romantic tradition that
kept naval shipbuilding in its antebellum
condition. Burning coal in warships cost
money; the wind, if not as dependable,
was free. Sails continued to make good
sense on long-distance cruises. America
still had no foreign coaling stations to support
a distant steam fleet, and isolationist
sentiment hindered their acquisition.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>For the same political and strategic reasons,
America&rsquo;s was a cruising navy, made
up of ships not intended for naval battle
but for scouting, showing the flag, and
commerce raiding. Wooden hulls sufficed
for such roles. The government and private
enterprise continued to look inland,
and iron was used instead for rails and
bridges to speed westward expansion. In
any case, American metallurgy lagged
behind that of Britain, while diminishing
timber supplies made British designers
look to alternate hull materials&mdash;not the
case in the United States.</p>
<p>If the Navy in general and navy yards in
particular declined in the 1870s, Charlestown&rsquo;s
relative position was strong. From
after the war to the early &rsquo;80s, Charlestown
was the second most productive yard
after New York. A large number of vessels
came to the yard for repair&mdash;mostly
wooden vessels with steam engines. To
service these ships, Charlestown in the
1870s continued to hire more machinists,
engineers, boilermakers, and patternmakers
while retaining a solid contingent of
wooden ship tradesmen.</p>
<p>Few new vessels were launched from
any yard in this period. In the last three
decades of the century Charlestown constructed
three&mdash;all in 1874. The screw
sloops <i>Vandalia</i> and <i>Adams</i> were
launched on successive days, the latter
(constructed at the yard by a private shipbuilder)
being the last wooden warship
laid down by the Navy. A few months earlier
the yard had launched its first iron-hulled
vessel, the torpedo ram <i>Intrepid</i>.
But it was not part of a general transition
to iron. The Navy built only four other
iron-hulled vessels, none of them major
warships. The 1874 launchings at the
Charlestown yard reflected the U.S.
Navy&rsquo;s lukewarm and indecisive response
to changing naval technology.</p>
<p>The yard by 1880 had changed little
since the improvements of the &rsquo;50s. It had
greater capacity now with four shiphouses
and two building ways, but the physical
plant also reflected the technological limbo
into which the Navy had settled. There
was a coaling wharf to service steamers
and a new rolling mill for iron plate. But
the large sail loft and wet timber dock were
still very much in use, and oxen still pulled
the timbers from dock to sawmill.</p>
<p>The dry dock was occupied by <i>Hartford</i>
in 1879-80. It was receiving new engines
after long tours in the 1860s and &rsquo;70s on Far
Eastern stations. Its two-year stay in the
dock&mdash;longer than normally needed for
such a job&mdash;testified to the general state of
affairs. The shrinking fleet had reduced the
work load and slowed the pace at the yard.
Under such conditions it was cheaper to
use a smaller crew and take longer to do
the work.</p>
<p>That the Navy was willing to give this
much attention to so honored a ship as
<i>Hartford</i> is understandable. But it symbolized
the fact that it was only putting off the
inevitable&mdash;modernization. By the early
1880s the U.S. Navy floundered in the
wake of Europe&rsquo;s navies&mdash;the victim of
limited funds, tradition-bound officers,
political neglect, and popular indifference.
There were but 48 decaying vessels in commission,
most at a Civil War or even prewar
level of technology. On top of the other
problems, the corruption associated with
the administration of Ulysses S. Grant had
touched the Navy&mdash;including the Charlestown
yard&mdash;in the late 1870s. Here, as at
other yards, politicians found jobs for men
who were then expected to vote as they
were told. It is easy to see why one historian
has characterized this period as the &ldquo;low
water mark&rdquo; of the Navy.</p>
<p>There were rumors of yard closings.
Nothing happened immediately, but less
and less work came to Charlestown. Then,
in 1883, the Navy suspended all repair and
construction work at the yard and reduced
its role to manufacturing. So began hard
times at Charlestown Navy Yard, during
which it came perilously close to shutting
down altogether.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h4 class="interlude">The Yard&rsquo;s First Dry Dock</h4>
<p>Before dry docks came into use in the 16th century, the only way to service a ship&rsquo;s
hull was to &ldquo;careen&rdquo; it&mdash;heave it over on its side, still floating
(<i>see pages <a href="#Page_6">6-7</a></i>), or laying in the mud at low tide. It was difficult
and time-consuming and put great strain on the hull. The answer was the dry dock.
The concept is simple: float the vessel into a three-sided basin, then close the seaward
end and remove all the water. The vessel settles on a cradle, its hull accessible. To undock:
reflood the basin, open the seaward end and float the vessel out. But the concept&rsquo;s execution
required a finely-engineered complex of masonry, engines, pumps, reservoir, tunnels, culverts, valves, and
gates&mdash;in effect a huge well-coordinated machine. The Charlestown dry dock and the
one built concurrently at Norfolk, Va., were the first such naval structures in the country.
Six years under construction, the Charlestown dock was inaugurated in 1833 with
the docking of Constitution. It was 305 feet long (extended in
1856 to 370 feet and again in 1948 to 398 feet), 60 feet wide, and 30 feet deep&mdash;the Navy&rsquo;s
largest dry dock until the 1890s. It took the original eight pumps four to five hours
to empty the tremendous basin. Other operations were to some extent governed by
Boston Harbor&rsquo;s 10-foot tide. After the dock was enlarged the water level did not rise as
rapidly as the tide during filling, so it took two high tides to do the job.
For emptying and filling, the caisson was filled with water and sunk in place between
grooves in the dock walls. For docking and undocking, the caisson was emptied and
floated out of the way on the high tide (<i>see inset</i>). It took 24
men working hand pumps for an hour and a half to expel the water from the caisson. The
original wooden caisson lasted until 1901, when the steel caisson still in use today was completed.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Ironclad Technology</h4>
<p>The clash of ships at sea
embodies the ongoing technological
battle between arms
and armor: between deploying
ever more destructive
weapons and contriving ways
to withstand them. As long as
solid shot was the only way to
attack a ship&rsquo;s hull, heavy timbers
were usually armor
enough. Big wooden warships
were rarely sunk by even the
heaviest shot. (<i>Constitution</i> is
a particularly good example.)
But the rules of the game
changed with the coming of
more powerful and more
accurate guns, and especially
with the development of the
practical explosive shell in the
19th century. A shell could
open a gaping hole in a
heretofore impervious wooden
hull. By 1860 France and
then Britain had begun building
ironclads. In Britain, especially,
the rising cost of diminishing
timber supplies was
another incentive to experiment
with iron, both as armor
and for structural elements of
the hull. But in the United
States, wood was still cheaper
than iron. Also, though the
country had earlier experimented
with ironcladding, the
Navy resisted the new technology,
putting emphasis on
speed rather than armor. But
it quickly made up for lost
time after the beginning of the
Civil War. The Confederacy
took the lead, for the same
reason that the United States
had built &ldquo;super-frigates&rdquo; at
the end of the 18th century. A
country that could afford only
a small navy had to build
state-of-the-art warships. The
blockade-breaker C.S.S. <i>Virginia</i>
showed the lethal effectiveness
of its ironcladding on
its first outing (<i>see <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a></i>).
The next day U.S.S. <i>Monitor</i>
fought <i>Virginia</i> to a draw in the
first battle between ironclads
(<i>right</i>). The encounter spurred
European navies to accelerate
their ironclad programs, but
new breech-loading rifled
guns were demonstrating
greater armor-piercing ability.
In response iron, and then
steel, armor was made thicker
and harder, leading to still
more powerful guns. The gun
designers generally stayed a
step ahead, with the biggest

<h3 id="c5">The New Navy</h3>
<p>On first looking into the cavernous interior
of Shiphouse I, a visitor during the winter
of 1884 would have gotten the impression
that Charlestown was a busy shipyard.
Workers crawled over the almost
completed ship-of-the-line <i>Virginia</i>, swinging
hammers, sawing, pumping hydraulic
jacks&mdash;apparently applying the finishing
touches. But behind the house, growing
piles of four-foot lengths of wood told a
different story. The workers were breaking
up the old 74. <i>Virginia</i> had occupied
the shiphouse for more than 60 years,
through all but the first two of the yard&rsquo;s
launchings. Back in 1824, <i>Virginia</i> had
been within two months of making its own
trip down the ways. Now its day had
passed, and its great timbers were being
reduced to firewood and sold at auction.</p>
<p>Outside the shiphouse, very few workers could have been found among the silent
buildings. Charlestown was a moribund yard, barely functioning since its repair
and construction duties had been suspended the year before. Only the manufacturing
divisions still showed signs of life. In 1886 the yard would be officially converted
to a facility that manufactured equipment&mdash;especially rope&mdash;for vessels built
and repaired elsewhere.</p>
<p>The yard was also stripped of much of its
equipment and ordered to sell the vessels
in ordinary. Repair work fell to an all-time
low: between the 1883 docking of the
Charlestown-built double-ender <i>Talapoosa</i>
and 1890, the dry dock was used
exactly five times to do repair work for the
U.S. Navy&mdash;once on the yard tug and four
times on the floating gate for the dry dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Joiner Shop foreman George W. Burroughs, about 1901.</i></p>
</div>
<p>New construction was out of the question.
The yard had known for years that
the vessels already in the shiphouses and
on the building ways (labeled &ldquo;Rotten
Row&rdquo; by a local newspaper in 1882) would
never be launched. So it came as no surprise
that the order closing the yard also
condemned <i>Virginia</i>, two wooden steamers,
and a monitor&mdash;the latter three laid
down during the Civil War. Still, it was disheartening
that in the early 1880s a yard
that had built and repaired ships was
reduced to taking them apart.</p>
<p>At least the dismantling of vessels provided
employment for the workers, who at
this point felt quite vulnerable. Throughout
the 1880s, &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; (being laid off)
was always hanging over their heads. More
than 500 men were employed at the yard
when work was halted in mid-1883. There
were around 300 by the end of the year
and their ranks continued to thin, averaging
less than 200 until 1888&mdash;most of them
ropemakers, machinists, laborers, and
watchmen.</p>
<p>Until World War I, jobs connected with
supply would remain more stable than
those related to construction and repair. In
the late 1880s and &rsquo;90s, managers found
ways to transfer men in the latter trades to
other divisions within the yard in order to
keep their services on call. But in the early
&rsquo;80s the yard could find virtually no work
for men skilled in the craft of wooden shipbuilding&mdash;formerly
the elite of the workforce.
After <i>Virginia</i> and the other vessels
had been turned into stacks of wood, those
who had done the work were sent home.</p>
<p class="tb">Now let us look ahead some three decades
to 1917, by which time we find a yard dramatically
transformed. Eleven wharves
described a great arc at the confluence of
the Charles and Mystic Rivers. The familiar
old shiphouses had been replaced by a
large shipbuilding ways and steel plate
storage yards. The timber basin that had
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
long dominated the center of the yard was
gone, replaced by a new dry dock twice as
long as the first one. The other timber
basin at the east end of the yard had been
filled in and was now the site of gas and
oil tanks, a locomotive shed, and a gas
plant for acetylene torches.</p>
<p>It was a vital place, showing an intensity
not seen since the Civil War. In fact it was
again a wartime yard: after almost three
years of neutrality the United States had
entered the global conflict that was later
called World War I. Some 4,500 workers
worked two ten-hour shifts or around the
clock in three eight-hour shifts, answering
to a steam whistle instead of the bell that
had summoned 19th-century yard workers.
The wharves and docks were crowded
with three- and four-stacker steel ships,
some carrying the towering cage masts
that were a short-lived experiment of the
period. On the building ways, workers had
laid the keel of the fuel ship <i>Brazos</i>.</p>
<p>Electric lights illuminated the thousands
of men working on ships through the
night. Vessels under repair were alive with
the flare of welding torches and the tattoo
of pneumatic rivet guns. Over them
moved the arms of great cranes, including
a 150-ton floating derrick and a colossus
that traveled on tracks between dry docks.
Materials and equipment were transported
by yard locomotives that had replaced
the oxen (although horses still did service).
A mechanized coaling plant near
the old dry dock helped ease the dirty and
arduous task of fueling ships. But it was
apparently undependable, and at times
ships were coaled the old way.</p>
<p>Charlestown&rsquo;s main responsibility was
repairing the warships of a greatly enlarged
fleet: steel destroyers, armored
cruisers and battleships, submarines, and
wooden sub chasers. The yard also outfitted
and commissioned new vessels, converted
civilian vessels to wartime use,
armed merchantmen, and altered seized
German passenger liners to transport U.S.
troops to France.</p>
<p>More work came to the yard in 1917-18
than in any other comparable period in its
history before World War II. Some 450
vessels were serviced during those two
years. In addition Charlestown was a supply
depot and embarkation point. In all,
an average of 50 ships a day arrived at or
departed from the yard during the war.</p>
<p>By 1918 some 10,000 skilled workers,
laborers, and clericals worked at Charlestown.
Reflecting the growth of the labor
movement over the last three decades,
many of them belonged to trade unions
(although they could neither strike nor be
represented by the unions in wage negotiations).
Women working at the yard were
mostly naval yeomen, but a few worked as
radio and telephone operators, radio electricians,
and ropewalk machine tenders.</p>
<p>Yard employees worked in 17 trade
shops, the names of which characterized
the needs of modern steel shipbuilding:
Shipfitters (including riveters, drillers,
welders, sheet metal workers); Electrical;
Pattern (for cast metals); Chain; Copper/Pipefitting;
and other skills employed
in raising a steel ship.</p>
<p>Some of the old familiar shops survived
in reduced or altered roles. The sail loft
now produced mostly canvas bags, pea
jackets, and hammocks. The riggers loft
had become a versatile shop responsible
for an array of shipyard tasks. They still
worked aloft on stacks and steel masts;
directed dry docking and crane operations;
prepared shipways for launchings;
dove beneath ships in hardhat diving suits;
and continued to do the traditional rigger&rsquo;s
handiwork, such as the braided rope
fenders that protected ships&rsquo; hulls and the
fancy leatherwork and ropework still
common on naval vessels. The workers in
the joiner shop worked on the small
wooden boats built at the yard, but spent
much of their time making shipboard furniture.
The ropewalk continued to turn
out the large quantities of rope still needed
on steel ships.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The traditional shipyard hierarchy was
virtually unchanged: the crews of mechanics,
apprentices, and laborers were headed
by leadingmen; several leadingmen were
supervised by quartermen; and the quartermen
were under a chief quarterman or
they answered directly to the master who
headed the shop.</p>
<p>Unlike the hard times of the 1880s, the
employees at Charlestown had reason to
feel secure. Civil Service reforms of the
&rsquo;90s had already gone a long way toward
making merit, not political advantage, the
criterion for hiring and firing. And now, in
the hour of war, the Navy wanted to keep
its shipyard workers. In the months before
the United States entered the conflict,
officials had worried that employees
swept up in the popular sentiment for preparedness
would enlist. Secretary of the
Navy Josephus Daniels declared it the
&ldquo;patriotic duty&rdquo; of the workers to remain
at the yard, asserting that &ldquo;their services
to their country ... [are] as important as if
they were actually in the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the draft was initiated in 1917, the
Navy responded by gaining exemptions
for crucial classes of yard workers such as
supervisors, draftsmen, and skilled mechanics
and their helpers. The military draft
gave new meaning to the yard&rsquo;s &ldquo;six-muster&rdquo;
rule, by which any worker missing
six successive roll calls for any reason
could be fired. One week after any worker
was dismissed, the yard informed his
draft board.</p>
<p>The demand for workers and the boosted
war economy drove up wages. No
doubt prompted by this incentive and by
the exemption policy, some 240,000 men
applied for work at the yard in 1917-18.
But while Charlestown didn&rsquo;t lack for
applicants, filling the most skilled positions
was a continuing problem. To remedy
this (and to help workers gain exemptions),
the yard cut a year from the term
of apprenticeship and established a trade
school to train unskilled workers as
mechanics.</p>
<p class="tb">While World War I sped up Charlestown&rsquo;s
evolution from naval backwater to
modern shipyard, other factors had set the
process in motion. Time and expected
technological advances accounted for
some of it. But the transition was accelerated
at the yard by a larger transformation
of the Navy, prompted by the country&rsquo;s
position in a changing world and
completed on the stage of the Spanish-American
War.</p>
<p>Historians have tagged this transformation
the &ldquo;New Navy.&rdquo; If we simply compare
the numbers of the 1880 Navy, when
its aging fleet of wooden vessels ranked
12th in the world, to that of the 1900
Navy, when there were in commission or
on the stocks 17 steel battleships and a
number of armored cruisers, the label
&ldquo;new&rdquo; is certainly accurate. But there was
more to this than simply building new
steel ships to catch up to Europe. The
Navy&rsquo;s mission underwent a strategic shift
in this 20-year period.</p>
<p>The early phase involved a strengthening
of the Navy&rsquo;s capacity to carry out its
mission. For a century its job had been to
defend the shores and to ensure that other
navies allowed American merchant vessels
free trade anywhere in the world. Its
tactical traditions were one-on-one
engagements and hit-and-run commerce
raiding. But it was clear by the early 1880s
that the U.S. Navy was inadequate for
even these limited operations. Reformers
could point to obvious deficiencies as
European navies converted to armored
steel hulls in the 1870s and &rsquo;80s. The old
wooden navy had become a disgrace.</p>
<p>Powerful voices were raised in the
House Naval Affairs Committee, and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
1883 Congress appropriated money for
the steel cruisers <i>Atlanta</i>, <i>Boston</i>, and
<i>Chicago</i>, and the dispatch vessel <i>Dolphin</i>.
These vessels could still spread a large
area of sail, and by European standards
were not formidable, but the so-called
&ldquo;ABCD&rdquo; ships were the core of the New
Navy, the first small step towards making
the United States a true sea power.</p>
<p>For Charlestown, they were a mixed
blessing. The New Navy&rsquo;s need for maintenance
and repair bode well for the
future, but the immediate effect was devastating.
For the same legislation that
authorized new ships also established a
new criterion for repairing existing vessels.
Only repairs that cost less than 30%
(later reduced to 20%) of the cost of a
new ship of the same size could be performed.
This freed up funds to build the
new ships, but it also meant so little work
for shipyards that both repair and construction
work at Charlestown and three
other yards was suspended.</p>
<p>In its new role as manufacturing center,
the yard kept the ropewalk, rigging loft,
and sail loft open. The forge began producing
chain and anchors for the new
steel ships. But even these activities were
sporadic until later in the decade. A survey
done one March day in 1884 showed
that the ropewalk was spinning rope for
<i>Dolphin</i>&mdash;literally the only thing done
that day to help put warships to sea.</p>
<p>During the worst years of the 1880s the
ropewalk almost singlehandedly kept the
yard alive. It made itself an indispensable
facility by supplying virtually all of the
Navy&rsquo;s rope. Other shops followed its
lead, and by 1890 the Charlestown yard
had become an important general manufacturing
center, the only naval shipyard
producing rope, sail, anchors, and chain.
It was still unable to service ships, however.
In August 1890 <i>Chicago</i> was directed
to the yard for repairs, only to turn back
because the old dry dock wasn&rsquo;t in good
enough condition to accept the steel
cruiser. &ldquo;Repairs to engine bolts&rdquo; for
<i>Boston</i> typified the kind of task the yard
could perform.</p>
<p>But 1890 also marked the beginning of
the yard&rsquo;s rebirth. Congress appropriated
$152,000 for new machine tools and modernization
of Charlestown&rsquo;s crumbling
facilities. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to remake the
yard, but it was a start. It was also the
year that Commander Alfred Thayer
Mahan, president of the Naval War College
and one-time aide to the Charlestown
Navy Yard commandant, published
<i>The Influence of Sea Power Upon History,
1660-1783</i>. This important book
helped to stimulate the world-wide
buildup of naval forces prior to World
War I. His thesis (greatly simplified) was
as follows: A combination of geography,
population size, and &ldquo;national character&rdquo;
makes a great seafaring nation. Essential
to the continued well-being of such a
nation is a government that actively promotes
a vigorous maritime commerce.
&ldquo;Sea power&rdquo;&mdash;command of the sea
lanes&mdash;protects this commerce. Only
large concentrated fleets of capital ships
able to engage and destroy the enemy&rsquo;s
navy can create and maintain sea power.</p>
<p>Mahan&rsquo;s influence, both as author and
adviser to the Secretary of the Navy, was
pivotal. His writings strengthened the
hand of imperialists and reformers who
had called for new strategic thinking. The
United States, they reasoned, was a growing
industrial power with increasing overseas
interests, and some&mdash;among them
Mahan disciple and future Assistant Secretary
of the Navy and President Theodore
Roosevelt&mdash;believed the nation
should have a navy befitting its role, one
able to open markets, protect those economic
interests, and project U.S. power.</p>
<p>In a burst of enthusiasm recalling that
for the ship-of-the-line at the end of the
War of 1812, Congress in 1890 authorized
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
the country&rsquo;s first full-sized battleships.
They represented enormous commitments
of resources, time, and money.
Called &ldquo;coastline&rdquo; battleships to placate
still powerful coast defense advocates,
they were nevertheless another step in the
United States&rsquo; emergence by the turn of
the century as a world power with a widening
sphere of influence. The Navy kept
its faith in battleships until their vulnerability
to air power and the superiority of
aircraft carriers as attack weapons were
demonstrated in World War II.</p>
<p>Although a succession of battleships,
cruisers, submarines, and other vessels
were now being laid down, Charlestown
didn&rsquo;t immediately reap the benefits. The
majority of the warships launched between
1883 and 1905 were built by contract
in private yards, and Charlestown
built none of them. For most of the 1890s,
the yard continued to be primarily a manufacturing
facility. The New Navy&rsquo;s hulls
did account for much of the yard&rsquo;s repair
work. Steel hulls didn&rsquo;t rot, but they more
easily fouled with barnacles and seaweed
than a coppered wooden hull and were
less resistant to corrosion than iron. Maintaining
them became the Charlestown
yard&rsquo;s bread and butter.</p>
<p>The Spanish-American War broke this
pattern, making Charlestown once again a
repair yard. Besides the new warships the
United States was trying out against the
Spanish navy, there was also the &ldquo;mosquito
fleet&rdquo; (old monitors, converted yachts,
and other small craft used for coastal
defense during the war) to be maintained
and repaired. In all some 50 vessels were
serviced by 1,200-1,400 workers.</p>
<p>To beef up its workforce for war, the
yard began hiring more foreign workers,
especially from Scandinavian countries
with shipbuilding traditions. Charlestown
thereafter maintained a workforce averaging
over 2,000 during the two decades
before World War I&mdash;compared to the
fewer than 400 workers there through
most of the 1890s. The Spanish-American
War was pivotal, marking a permanent
expansion in the size and diversity of the
Charlestown workforce.</p>
<p>At war&rsquo;s end the United States was recognized
as a world power with attendant
responsibilities. This new status was symbolized
by the establishment of a coaling
station in the recently acquired Philippines.
The capital ship building program
continued apace&mdash;given renewed vigor by
President Theodore Roosevelt, staunch
advocate of big ships and a strong navy.</p>
<p>The yard continued to be mainly a
repair facility with a steadily increasing
workload. The new 750-foot Dry Dock 2,
authorized three months after the sinking
of <i>Maine</i>, was built to receive the Navy&rsquo;s
biggest ships. But soon after the massive
structure&rsquo;s 1905 completion, Britain
launched H.M.S. <i>Dreadnought</i>, ushering
in an even larger class of battleship the
dock could not accommodate.</p>
<p>In this period the yard specialized in the
smaller battleships and the newest type of
warship: destroyers. These fast, versatile
ships had evolved from British &ldquo;torpedo
boat destroyers&rdquo; built in the 1880s to
counter the new torpedo boats. The mobile
torpedo, also developed in Britain,
was a self-propelled explosive device
launched from a warship&rsquo;s deck, traveling
underwater to open the hull of its target.</p>
<p class="tb">Developments in naval technology from
the 1880s to the eve of World War II
included nothing quite so dramatic as the
epochal shifts from sail to steam and
wood to iron, but the period saw advances
in strategic weapons such as submarines
and aircraft carriers, and major innovations
that resulted in ships and shipbuilding
essentially like what we see today. In
the period before the age of flight, sophisticated
warships were highly visible
embodiments of the state of a nation&rsquo;s
technology, and the rapidly expanding
U.S. fleet was an unmistakable sign of its
growing industrial and technological
prominence.</p>

</div>
<p>The major innovations were again in
hull material and propulsion. The transition
from iron to steel hulls further liberated
naval engineers. Lighter, stronger,
and less brittle, steel allowed them more
play in hull size and proportions. Despite
extensive use of ironclads by the United
States during the Civil War, its navy
essentially skipped the iron stage in
seagoing warships, moving from <i>Hartford</i>-type
wooden steamers to the steel
ABCD ships of 1883. While the Charlestown
yard launched no steel warships
until the 1930s, it did construct the tug
<i>Pentucket</i> (1903) and training bark <i>Cumberland</i>
(1904), both steel-hulled.</p>
<p>As steam engines grew more efficient
in the 1880s and &rsquo;90s, sailing rigs were
made smaller and vestigial masts served
mainly as radio antennae and platforms
for directing big guns. But a revolution in
steam technology sent reciprocating
engines the way of masts on most large
naval vessels. Steam turbines, which were
much more efficient at sustained high
speeds, were developed in the 1880s in
Europe and used in 1905 on <i>Dreadnought</i>.
In America they became truly
practical during the World War I period.</p>
<p>Along with the introduction of turbines
came an innovation in the fuel that powered
them. During the 1890s oil was
introduced, used in combination with
coal. By 1910 the United States had built
its first all oil-burning warship. Besides
providing greater power more quickly,
oil needed less storage space and fewer
engine room hands than coal.</p>
<p>These advances and refinements completed
the evolution of the U.S. Navy
warship from wooden-hulled sailing vessel
to powered steel ship. But perfecting
the new technology was not the only
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
challenge associated with the transition.
The demands of modern naval design
provoked growing controversy over how
work should be performed at naval shipyards
and how those yards should be
organized. Charlestown Navy Yard
played a central role in the debate.</p>
<p>Since 1868 the nation&rsquo;s naval shipyards had each been organized into departments
corresponding to those at the Navy Department level. Each department
head, though nominally under the yard commandant, really worked for his boss
in Washington. So each department became in effect a separate plant protecting
its own interests and budget. When a yard built relatively simple wooden-hulled
ships powered by steam engines, the tasks of the Construction and Steam
Engineering departments differed enough that there was little overlap. The old organization
was not then a problem. But as warships became complex, integrated
machines the system broke down, providing little coordination between departments
and a great deal of duplication. By 1910 it was grossly wasteful and inefficient,
a public scandal.</p>
<p>At about the same time as reformers were calling for a shakeup of naval shipyards,
the phrase &ldquo;scientific management&rdquo; was being bandied about. Everyone
recognized that the 19th-century industrial system, while highly successful,
had to be managed differently to best incorporate 20th-century technology. The
most famous of the new management systems was that of Frederick Winslow Taylor.
Taylor&rsquo;s system called for the strict application of scientific methods to industrial
management and organization in order to produce the maximum output.
Specifically, efficiency experts would study workers&rsquo; tasks and break them
down into their smallest components; perform time-and-motion studies to eliminate
wasteful motions and determine the optimum time in which a task should be
completed; and offer wage incentives and penalties for meeting or falling short of
the new standards. There would be no reason for bargaining or for unions since
non-debatable scientific principles, rather than human foibles and emotions, would
govern management decisions.</p>
<p>The workers&rsquo; response to Taylorism was speedy and unequivocal. They fiercely
resisted any system that would analyze their movements as if they were machines
to be fine-tuned (not an exaggeration of Taylor&rsquo;s stated beliefs). Such a system,
they said, would demean them and their skills&mdash;robbing them of their autonomy
and individuality; eliminating craft from the job; turning workers into mere cogs
performing sped-up, repetitious tasks &ldquo;to the physical breaking point&rdquo;&mdash;not to
mention the threat to collective bargaining. So visceral was their reaction to Taylorism
that any kind of management system became suspect.</p>
<p>Thus when the Navy attempted in 1912 to introduce a British management system&mdash;less
doctrinaire than Taylorism, though with the same ends of efficiency
and increased production&mdash;workers at Charlestown were immediately on their
guard. The system&rsquo;s reorganization of the yard&rsquo;s divisions also upset established
power relationships between traditional sea (line) officers and newer and often
younger engineering (staff) types, tilting the balance in favor of the latter. Not surprisingly,
line and staff were polarized over the merits of the new order, accusing
each other respectively of obstructing progress and overmanaging.</p>
<p>In this charged atmosphere, when two overzealous junior officers attempted to
introduce minute Taylor-like task breakdowns at Charlestown, the metal workers
at the yard took action. They asked their congressman to hand-deliver a protest to
Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. While Roosevelt agreed in
principle with scientific management, he was generally sympathetic to labor and
refused to implement a system that the yard workers opposed.</p>

<p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s visit to the yard in 1913, during
which he let it be known that certain
junior officers were being reassigned,
focused national attention on the controversy
and encouraged other yard workers
around the nation. A delegation representing
them lobbied against Taylorism,
eventually persuading Congress to outlaw
such management systems in navy yards.
Yet when it was all over, the Charlestown
yard was organized quite differently than
in the 19th century, making it a more efficient
builder and repairer of modern
naval vessels and helping it to perform as
it did during World War I.</p>
<p>U.S.S. <i>Bridge</i>, commissioned as the first
American troops were enroute to France,
exemplified the yard&rsquo;s progress since the
dark 1880s. Following a long campaign by
a job-desperate Boston to have the ship
built at Charlestown, <i>Bridge</i> was laid
down in 1914 and launched two years later.
It was the Navy&rsquo;s first refrigerated supply
ship, with a steel hull and a boiler that
could burn oil or coal. Its 423-foot length
made <i>Bridge</i> the largest vessel yet built at
Charlestown and its first major ship since
the 1870s.</p>
<p>After demonstrating its competence
with <i>Bridge</i>, Charlestown was assigned
<i>Brazos</i>, two other fuel ships, and a
destroyer tender. The war-spurred building
program helped Charlestown stay
busy when peace came, as the last three
vessels weren&rsquo;t laid down until after the
armistice. In fact the number of employees
actually rose, to almost 13,000 in 1919.
Besides the shipbuilding, there was work
converting ships to troop transports to
bring the soldiers home and stripping military
gear from ships returning to civilian
service. Charlestown repaired a large
number of destroyers, subs, and battleships
small enough for Dry Dock 2. To
increase its docking capacity, the yard purchased
in 1920 a new state-built dry dock
in South Boston. At the time it was the
country&rsquo;s largest dry dock, becoming the
nucleus of the yard&rsquo;s South Boston Annex.</p>
<p>Events conspired in the 1920s to dampen
the yard&rsquo;s postwar prosperity. The 1922
Five-Power Treaty limited new ship construction
and the overall number of vessels,
meaning less repair and outfitting
work for naval shipyards. In any case the
political mood was to spend money on other
things. After the destroyer tender <i>Whitney</i>
was launched in 1923, there was no
more construction at Charlestown, other
than a couple of tugs, for the rest of the
decade. And as the Japanese grew increasingly
expansionist, much of the fleet was
moved to the West Coast, further reducing
work at the yard.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Charlestown kept up its
steady repair work, especially on destroyers,
albeit at a more modest level and with
a workforce reduced to below 3,000 by
1922. The addition of a marine railway in
1919 allowed the yard to more easily service
smaller ships of up to 2,000 tons.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade further developments
seriously threatened the Charlestown
yard. The London Naval Treaty of
1930 extended the moratorium on new
capital ship construction for another six
years. The treaty further required the U.S.
to scrap three battleships and 94 destroyers&mdash;the
latter a mainstay of Charlestown.
The deepening Depression also hurt the
yard, as the government&rsquo;s austerity program
in the early years of the crisis
reduced work at naval shipyards. The
Hoover administration threatened to close
most federal yards, including Charlestown.
Yet in the Depression itself we can trace
the roots of the coming boom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Building a Steel Ship</h4>
<p>Beginning in the 1880s, steel rapidly supplanted wood as the primary material in U.S.
naval vessels. Charlestown began building large steel vessels in 1915-20, the period
depicted below. Stronger per pound than wood or iron, steel enabled naval architects
to design bigger ships that could carry more armament. Steel was also better suited to
bearing the massive weight of steam engines and boilers. The structural members of
early steel vessels were riveted together, with limited gas welding in use by World War I.
Shipyard artisans traded auger, saw, and mallet for pneumatic drill, gas cutting
torch, and pneumatic rivet gun. Massive steam-powered cranes replaced the old hoisting
shears. Yet, while a riveted steel ship demanded vastly more complicated plans and
a higher level of coordination between shops, it was assembled in much the same way as
a wooden vessel. From the keel rose the stem, sternpost, and frames. Transverse
beams, longitudinals, vertical stanchions, watertight bulkheads, decking, and plating
completed the hull, all held together by rivets. Electric welding (<i>below</i>), developed in
the 1930s, allowed still lighter construction and the prefabrication of sections. Designers,
however, still called for rivets for some parts of the hull throughout World War II.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Chain for the Navy</h4>
<p>Until World War I, forged iron chain was used on naval vessels, and the forge shop at the
Charlestown yard was a leader in the industry. But it was a laborious process, and
the demands of war spurred the development of cast steel chain, which could be produced
more quickly. Charlestown was soon experimenting with detachable links to connect
standard chain lengths. This led to the development in 1926 of a new chainmaking
process, in which each link was made from half-links joined in a die under a drop-forge
hammer&mdash;&ldquo;die-lock&rdquo; chain. It was clearly superior: more uniform, stronger,
cheaper to make. By the early 1930s Charlestown was producing die-lock chain in several
sizes, and by 1936 die-lock had superseded cast steel chain for all sizes. The
shop made the chain used in most U.S. naval vessels built during World War II and was
the only forge to make chain for the largest postwar aircraft carriers.</p>

<h3 id="c6">The Yard Transformed</h3>
<p>It was not a dramatic launch&mdash;no gathering speed down the shipways and plunging into
Boston Harbor. Instead, the water flowing into Dry Dock 1 rose slowly around U.S.S.
<i>MacDonough</i> until the destroyer lifted off the keel blocks and was towed out of the
dock. The 1934 &ldquo;floating&rdquo; was low-keyed but significant. <i>MacDonough</i> was the first
warship built by Charlestown since the wooden screw sloop <i>Vandalia</i> slid down
the ways in 1874.</p>
<p>The technological leap between the two vessels&mdash;partially bridged by the steel supply
and fuel ships Charlestown built in the World War I period&mdash;was considerable.
Except for its coal-fired auxiliary steam propulsion, the 216-foot <i>Vandalia</i> did not
differ significantly from the old <i>Constitution</i>. <i>MacDonough</i> was a modern destroyer&mdash;the
sloop-of-war&rsquo;s 20th-century counterpart&mdash;incorporating the advances of the
past 60 years. It was powered by geared turbines driven by steam generated in oil-burning
boilers, and relied on sophisticated electrical, hydraulic, and communications
systems. At 341 feet, its steel hull took up most of Dry Dock 1.</p>
<p>As soon as <i>MacDonough</i> was moved out of the dock, the destroyer <i>Monaghan</i>, just
floated from Dry Dock 2, was moved into #1 for completion and outfitting. Two
more keels were immediately laid in #2. It is noteworthy that neither dry dock was
being used to repair ships. In fact, the whole yard&rsquo;s traditional role as repair facility
had given way in the past year to a new one as shipbuilder, a status it maintained
through World War II. Charlestown built 12 destroyers in the 1930s and 24 more by
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the end of the war. Of course the yard built and serviced other types of vessels&mdash;especially
destroyer escorts and LSTs (Landing Ship Tank)&mdash;but Charlestown
acquired a reputation as a &ldquo;destroyer yard&rdquo; and thereafter specialized in this
workhorse of the Navy.</p>

<p>Ironically, the change had been brought
about by the same economic crisis that
almost put an end to the yard. After considering
closing all yards but Norfolk and
Philadelphia to save money, the Hoover
administration in 1931 proposed closing
only the Charlestown yard. Reaction was
swift: committees were formed in Boston;
petitions protesting the closing were
signed. But it was probably the fact that
<i>MacDonough</i> had been ordered a month
earlier that tilted the scales in the yard&rsquo;s
favor. The keel was not laid for two years,
however, and 1932 was the yard&rsquo;s bleakest
year since before the Spanish-American
War, with only 1,500 people employed.</p>
<p>The Roosevelt administration&rsquo;s program
to stimulate the economy, provide jobs,
and pull the nation out of the Depression
was the first step in Charlestown&rsquo;s transformation
into a true ship construction
yard. Under FDR&rsquo;s 1933 National Industrial
Recovery Act, 32 new warships were
authorized, 20 of them destroyers, of
which two were assigned to Charlestown.
The following year, growing worries about
Japanese aggression moved Congress to
further expand the Navy.</p>
<p>The yard kept a rapid pace in the 1930s,
laying two keels simultaneously in Dry
Dock 2 in 1934 and again in 1935. (As the
shipways was inadequate for destroyers, all
keels were laid in this dock until 1939.)
After floating, the hulls were moved into
Dry Dock 1 for completion, the whole
process taking about two years.</p>
<p>Repair work was much reduced in the
1930s by federal economy measures specifying
lengthened maintenance intervals.
As both dry docks were in any case usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
tied up in construction work, and because
most of the ships in for repair were relatively
small, many of these vessels were
floated into a large cradle and hauled
from the water up the tracks of the yard&rsquo;s
marine railway. Others were taken across
the harbor to the South Boston dry dock.</p>
<p class="tb">Technological change transformed many
of the yard&rsquo;s oldest trades by the 1930s,
while the growing size and complexity of
ships required more and more workers.
Such large government employers as shipyards
were seen by policy makers as
places to both promote economic stability
and save money. Early in the Depression
these two goals were addressed, respectively,
with lower and upper limits for
each yard&rsquo;s workforce&mdash;at Charlestown,
1,500 and 1,800. The workforce stayed
generally within these limits until 1935,
when it began growing, reaching some
5,000 workers by late 1939. (During hard
times the yard kept its eye on the future,
exempting apprentices from layoffs.)</p>
<p>By the time war had begun in Europe in
1939, with &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; again America&rsquo;s
watchword, the yard was operating at an
even faster rate of production than in the
mid-thirties. With the shipways enlarged
to handle destroyers, six ships were in
some stage of construction that summer.
In October four destroyers were floated
out of Dry Dock 2 on the same day. The
yard also prepared 18 of the old World
War I four-stacker destroyers for transfer
to Britain under the 1940 destroyers-for-bases
agreement.</p>
<p>Then came the war. If the thirties had
been a period of gearing up, wartime
pushed the yard into overdrive. It took a
great war effort for the yard to realize its
true shipbuilding and manufacturing
potential, confirming a statement by Secretary
of the Navy George von Meyer in
1910: &ldquo;Navy yards are primarily for war
and only incidentally for peace.&rdquo; One historian&rsquo;s
conservative estimate: under the
goad of war the yard built, repaired, overhauled,
converted, or outfitted some 6,000
vessels between 1939 and 1945.</p>
<p>The raid on Pearl Harbor in December
1941 made every naval installation fearful
of enemy attacks. Charlestown installed
anti-aircraft batteries on roofs and camouflaged
waterfront buildings. Some security
measures were disruptive of yard routine.
Blackouts and dim-outs were in force,
especially in the early years of the war, to
reduce the chances of ships being silhouetted
against lights. When the air raid whistle
blew, workers had to stop what they
were doing and go to shelters. Throughout
the war, yard officials juggled the conflicting
demands of security and production.</p>
<p>Other security measures had more personal
consequences. Some yard workers
were banned from certain areas, and
everyone was forbidden to speak foreign
languages while at work. A number of
workers were suspended in 1941 as security
risks. &ldquo;Remarks ... inimical to the government&rdquo;
were enough to earn an employee
a place on the suspension list.</p>
<p>The huge number of people working at
Charlestown was another sign that the
yard had been remade by war. The U.S.
Navy became the world&rsquo;s largest single
employer of industrial labor during the
conflict, and the Charlestown yard held
the same status in the Boston area. The
yard&rsquo;s force rapidly swelled from 5,000
workers in 1939 to a high of about 50,000
at Charlestown and its annexes in mid-1943,
working around the clock in three
eight-hour shifts.</p>
<p>As in World War I, the yard again had
to protect its essential employees from the
draft board. But voluntary enlistment
proved to be the real drain on the workforce.
Although yard foremen tried to dissuade
crucial employees from going, some
13,000 workers left the yard to join the
fight. Throughout the conflict, even when
more than 50,000 people worked there,
the yard was shorthanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Mainstays of the Yard: Warship Overhaul and Repair</h4>
<p>After the construction boom
created by World War II,
Charlestown resumed its traditional
role of &ldquo;serving the
fleet&rdquo; (the yard&rsquo;s motto). In the
early 1950s it was the home
yard for 121 vessels, including
U.S.S. <i>Cassin Young</i>, the
destroyer now on exhibit at
the yard. All types of ships, but
especially destroyers, came
for everything from minor
repairs to overhauls on established
cycles. The latter, which
often involved some degree of
modernization, could require
800 to 900 workers a day.
After the war the yard preserved
decommissioned vessels
of the Atlantic Reserve
Fleet berthed at the South
Boston Annex. Charlestown
also prepared ships for transfer
to allies, outfitted vessels
built elsewhere, and repaired
equipment, especially sonar.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>To make up for the shortages, the yard
began for the first time hiring significant
numbers of women and African Americans.
Their door of opportunity, unlocked
by the needs of a war economy, was kept
open by pressure from civil rights groups
on the Roosevelt administration (often
relayed by a sympathetic Eleanor Roosevelt).
Women at the yard had traditionally
worked in clerical positions and as
phone operators, and this remained true
at war&rsquo;s outset. But more and more women
found work in the industrial shops,
notably as welders and at the ropewalk
(the latter having employed them during
World War I). At least in some shops,
however, there were restrictions. Gloria
Brandenberg, who worked in the Paint
Shop, recalled that all painter&rsquo;s helpers
were female, supervised by a woman (the
&ldquo;leading lady&rdquo;), while all painters were
male. Brandenberg said there was no
chance for advancement.</p>
<p>By 1943 female blue-collar workers outnumbered
women in clerical positions.
Some 7,700 women were on the rolls in
late 1944&mdash;far above their prewar level
and about 19 percent of the workforce.
Many worked as welders on ships under
construction, but yard officials wary of
contact between female workers and male
crews barred women from all vessels in for
repair. Painter&rsquo;s helper Brandenberg
recalled that the women were not allowed
even to talk to sailors.</p>
<p>While African Americans were not officially
excluded from Charlestown&rsquo;s prewar
workforce, few had been employed.
When the war created opportunities for
them, some whites openly resisted their
presence in skilled positions. But this was
not a universal attitude. Allan Crite, a
black illustrator in the Design Department,
said he experienced no racial problems.
Inevitably, though, tensions arose in
some areas. Gloria Brandenberg recalled
an evening at a social club with her
coworkers from the Paint Shop, one of
whom was African American. She was
asked to leave. The group talked it over;
they all left. But the records show no
major racial conflict at the yard. At war&rsquo;s
end more than 2,300 African Americans
were in the force of 32,000 workers.</p>
<p>By late 1942, the yard had settled into a
wartime routine&mdash;to the extent that routine
is possible during war. Normal peacetime
constraints didn&rsquo;t apply. &ldquo;During the
war there wasn&rsquo;t much emphasis on estimates,&rdquo;
recalled plumber Lyman Carlow.
&ldquo;For one thing, there wasn&rsquo;t time. Here&rsquo;s
the job; we need the ship right away; get it
done and whatever it costs it costs ... it was
just a real frantic pace ... the material just
flowed in ... plenty of people, so we could
really get the work done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than the higher level of general
activity and the large numbers of workers
(around 36,000 at this point), it was the
volume of new construction that characterized
the wartime yard. A walk around
the yard on November 23 would have
revealed ships being built in every facility
but Dry Dock 2, used only for repairs.</p>
<p>Workers generally laid down and
launched large vessels in pairs. But while
floating two at a time out of a dry dock
was standard practice, it was never approached
casually. John Langan, a shipfitter
during the war, recalled: &ldquo;It was quite a
feat, two destroyers right alongside each
other, flooding the dock, and not having
them crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new shipways built in early 1941
helped quicken the pace of production. In
that year 10 destroyers were laid down,
the most in any one year. By late 1941 the
yard&rsquo;s workers had pushed the time for
building a destroyer down to a little over a
year and would cut it to three or four
months from keel to launching by the end
of the war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Women in the Workforce</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We all felt that we were doing our job, and the
harder we worked, the faster we would get the
ships out and the faster it would get over. Deep

<p>As enlistments and competition from private industry depleted the pool of male
workers during World War II, the Navy looked to the large numbers of women who
wanted to do their part for the war effort. Women had long worked at the Charlestown
yard, although almost exclusively (except during World War I) in clerical positions.
But beginning in 1942 the easing of state workweek restrictions for women hastened
their recruitment into the yard&rsquo;s manufacturing and traditional shipyard shops. The
intention was to have them replace men in relatively unskilled positions requiring
little training. And in fact most women did work as helpers in their shops, often with little
chance of advancement. But some moved into the trades as machinists, riveters,
painters, riggers, pipefitters, and especially as welders and ropewalk workers. At the
same time women still occupied more than half of the yard&rsquo;s clerical positions. Altogether,
they made up about one-fifth of the yard workforce by 1945. Those in the
trades knew their jobs would likely end when the war did, but the point had been made.
In 1945, a yard historian wrote: &ldquo;Experience over the past two years has proven
that female employees are able to work efficiently on an equal basis with men on many
jobs that were formerly considered to be men&rsquo;s jobs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new shipways was also used to build
destroyer escorts (DEs)&mdash;smaller, slower,
and less expensive versions of destroyers
designed for escort duty and antisubmarine
warfare. Escorted convoys had
proven to be the only effective way to
thwart U-boat &ldquo;wolf packs&rdquo; preying on
allied shipping. In 1942, after the Navy
ordered the first of more than a thousand
DEs, Charlestown built a new dry dock in
which it could turn out four at a time. The
next year 50 DEs were laid down at the
yard, half of which were destined for
Britain in accordance with the Lend-Lease
Act of 1941. Charlestown got the production
of DEs down to an art: of the 62 it
built, workers launched an impressive 46
in the first eleven months of 1943.</p>
<p>If 1941 was the year of the destroyer at
the yard and 1943 belonged to the DE,
1944 was the year of the LST (Landing
Ship, Tank). These seagoing assault vessels
carried tanks and other vehicles during
amphibious landings. The yard laid
down 30 in 1944, taking only a month to
complete one of the 328-foot vessels.</p>
<p>In all, Charlestown built 174 large vessels
during the war, including 12 barracks ships
and four submarines. There were also
hundreds of smaller craft, such as wooden
motor launches and diver boats. The
South Boston Annex played a part in the
yard&rsquo;s strong wartime performance, doing
much of the repair and conversion work
and fabricating hull sections that were
towed to Charlestown for incorporation
into ships under construction.</p>
<p>Not all vessels were built outside: in the
summer of 1942, shipfitters fabricated in
their shop 150 fifty-foot LCMs (Landing
Craft, Mechanized)&mdash;also called &ldquo;tank
lighters&rdquo;&mdash;for the British-American invasion
of North Africa. Shipfitter John Langan
remembered it as a &ldquo;crash program....
We just stopped everything else and concentrated
on them and delivered them for
the invasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this kind of rapid, assembly-line
construction was Charlestown&rsquo;s specialty
during the war, there were other claims on
the yard&rsquo;s time. By late 1942 war&rsquo;s reality
was being brought home to Charlestown
in the shape of battle-scarred ships needing
quick repair. When a damaged ship
arrived, it was given priority until it was
ready to return to combat.</p>
<p>There was another reason for the air of
urgency around war repairs: ship repair
generally called for more skill than did
shipbuilding. Because workers often had
to work blind on battle damage until its
nature and extent could be determined,
such work called on all the workers&rsquo;
resourcefulness. John Langan remembered
&ldquo;everybody fighting to get them
[war-damaged vessels], because it is good
work.&rdquo; Langan recalled one vessel towed
into the yard: it had been &ldquo;torpedoed and
cut right in halves ... and the fireroom was
open to the seas ... [They had] tied her
down with big I-beams ... tied them the full
length, all the way around&rdquo;&mdash;to keep the
ship afloat until it reached the yard.</p>
<p>Even without the shell-torn hulls and
shredded superstructures, war is hard on
ships. Pushed faster, farther, and longer
under less than ideal conditions, they
needed more than routine maintenance.
And on top of the already demanding
schedule of ship construction, repair, and
maintenance, other tasks competed for
time and resources. Yard workers outfitted
naval vessels built at other yards. They
converted private vessels and old naval
ships to wartime uses. They manufactured
turbines and thousands of tons of die-lock
chain (<i>see pages <a href="#Page_60">60-61</a></i>). They &ldquo;degaussed&rdquo;
hulls&mdash;neutralized their magnetic fields so
they would not trip mines. Together these
activities suggest the scope and grueling
pace of the yard&rsquo;s war effort.</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere, mishaps caused
by fallible humans dealing with complex
machinery were inevitable. One particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
embarrassing, and nearly tragic, incident
was related by electrical shop foreman
Mel Hooper. His men were completing
electrical work on the new submarine
<i>Lancefish</i> (built at another yard) in 1945.
&ldquo;Some machinist went down,&rdquo; he recalled,
&ldquo;and opened up the front gate on the torpedo
tube and forgot to close it; then he
went back in the ship and opened up the
inside one and then it started to flood.
And they had a hell of a job trying to close
it, and they couldn&rsquo;t close it, and everybody
ran aboard the dock to get the hell
out of there before they got drowned.
And then the ship sank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stepped-up safety program was
almost certainly an improvement on the
pre-war conditions, when, as remembered
by plumber Lyman Carlow, &ldquo;It seemed to
me that everyone was supposed to look
after himself.&rdquo; But while the program
called for more protections for workers
from open machinery, hazardous fumes,
and other dangerous conditions, a survey
in 1944 noted that workers were rarely
disciplined for safety violations, machines
lacked guards, and most workers did not
wear their hard hats, goggles, or ear protection.
&ldquo;You [went] down to the tanks
with the chipping hammers and riveting
guns going all around,&rdquo; recalled Carlow,
&ldquo;and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear for a
couple of hours afterward. But nobody
did anything about it, or thought anything
of it. You just got deaf, and that was it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shipyard was a dangerous place to
work even in peacetime; war multiplied
the hazards. Charles Snell, an apprentice
rigger at the yard, recalled 40 years later,
&ldquo;We had a lot of close escapes, because
safety wasn&rsquo;t really stressed then as much
as it is today ... we lost a lot of riggers,
strangely enough, and I can never account
for this, being run over by the cranes ... the
operator of the crane, when it was traveling,
had very limited visibility close ahead.
And we lost an inordinate number of riggers
because they&rsquo;d stumble and the crane
would run over them.... We had quite a
few falls into the dry dock, not riggers, but
all trades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snell left the yard in 1943 and served in
Europe for the duration of the war. He
recalled his impressions upon returning in
1946, comparing the yard to &ldquo;a runner,
which was running for an objective, and
all of a sudden, the objective wasn&rsquo;t there.
The need for everything had suddenly
evaporated. And it was a question of what
do you finish and what don&rsquo;t you finish,
and what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With peace came the end of Charlestown&rsquo;s
brief period as a major shipbuilding
center. But the war-seasoned yard did
not simply revert to what it had been
before. Charlestown found a new postwar
role as a place where old vessels were
remade from the inside out, transformed
into modern warships. Old did not necessarily
mean long in years. In the 1950s,
ships that had performed admirably in the
late war were being left behind in a world
of accelerating technological change.
Charlestown extended their careers,
installing state-of-the-art electronics.
When advances in missile technology
opened a new era in naval weapons and
strategy, Charlestown played a leading
role in the changeover. The life of the
crowded and aging yard itself was extended
by such activities, enabling Charlestown
to render another three decades of
service to the country.</p>
<p>In the months after war&rsquo;s end, the level
of activity naturally fell off, but the yard
remained busy converting transports to
bring home the troops, inactivating ships,
and completing the last few LSTs, barracks
ships, and subs laid down in 1945.
Charlestown also carved a niche for itself
in sonar, a technology dating to the World
War I period and considered standard
equipment since the 1930s. Beginning in
1948 the yard became a center for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
repair of sonar equipment, establishing a
sonar laboratory and developing techniques
adopted by other electronics repair
centers throughout the Navy.</p>
<p>Radar, developed in the 1930s, had come
into widespread use during the war. The
yard undertook a major conversion program
in 1950 when it began upgrading
radar and sonar systems on a number of
destroyers and destroyer escorts, converting
them to radar picket and antisubmarine
warfare (ASW) roles. Charlestown
also planned and designed all alterations,
wherever they were performed, to cruisers,
destroyers, escort carriers, LSTs, and several
auxiliary vessel types.</p>
<p>While the yard accepted a variety of vessels,
including aircraft carriers, it continued
its traditional specialization in destroyers
and destroyer escorts. In 1955 the yard
converted the 10-year-old <i>Gyatt</i> into the
world&rsquo;s first guided missile destroyer.</p>
<p>That year the yard laid down the keel of
its only postwar vessel and the last one it
built: the LST <i>Suffolk County</i>, first of a
larger and faster class of LSTs. Charlestown
also served as the design yard for the
other six LSTs, built in private yards.</p>
<p>In the 1960s the yard stayed busy with
outfittings, missile and ASW conversions,
and Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization
(FRAM) overhauls that added five to
seven years of service to aging warships.
Charlestown&rsquo;s FRAM program specialized
in World War II-era destroyers. Ranging
from brief dockings to major operations of
a year or more costing millions, these projects
involved such sophisticated work as
installing or upgrading sonar (<i>see pages <a href="#Page_76">76-77</a></i>),
radar, communications, and computer
equipment; major alterations such as
replacing engines and entire superstructures;
and the more prosaic tasks the yard
had been performing for over a century:
cleaning and painting hulls, renovating
propellers and rudders, and rebricking or
replacing boilers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by 1972 work was falling
off at Charlestown, and signs did not bode
well for the yard&rsquo;s future. For years the
Navy had invested little there for maintenance
or modernization, making it harder
to stay efficient. The marine railway and
ropewalk had been shut down in 1971.
Elsewhere, superfluous or inefficient military
bases were being closed to save money.
(The New York Navy Yard was closed
in 1966.) A massive infusion of funds was
needed to upgrade the old Charlestown
yard&mdash;too small in any case for proper
expansion of its facilities.</p>
<p>The Navy in general was retrenching for
economic reasons. The destroyer fleet,
especially&mdash;the lifeblood of the yard in the
20th century&mdash;had steadily dwindled since
1960. The fewer destroyers there were to
service, the harder it was to justify the
Charlestown yard&rsquo;s existence. The failure
of the Navy to carry through modernization
plans, including one whereby the
majority of the yard&rsquo;s industrial activity
would be transferred to an enhanced
South Boston facility, helped to hasten the
inevitable. Many associated with the yard
also suspected that Massachusetts, as the
only state going Democratic in the 1972
presidential election, would pay a penalty
for failing to back the winner.</p>
<p>On April 16, 1973, the yard commander,
Captain R. L. Arthur, announced that the
Charlestown yard, along with the yard at
Hunter&rsquo;s Point in San Francisco, was to
close. Over the next year it ceased all fleet
servicing and manufacturing operations,
and on July 1, 1974, nearly 175 years of
service to the nation ended with a formal
disestablishment ceremony. Only one
naval activity remained at Charlestown:
the protection and maintenance of the old
warship long associated with the yard,

<h4 class="interlude">Ships for World War II</h4>
<p>From 1933 to the end of World
War II, the Charlestown yard
moved outside its traditional
role as repair yard and became
a shipbuilding facility. It
began with destroyers&mdash;ships
it had long specialized in
repairing&mdash;averaging two a
year in the 1930s. This period
of steady production was preamble
to the World War II
crash building program.
Charlestown launched almost
200 vessels, including 24
destroyers, between 1939 and
1945. In 1942 it began building
destroyer escorts&mdash;smaller,
less expensive versions of
destroyers designed to counter
German submarines. The final
big program was the production
of LSTs (Landing Ship,
Tank) for amphibious assaults
in Europe and Asia. LSDs
(Landing Ship, Dock) for carrying
other vessels; submarines;
and various auxiliary vessels
also came down the ways during
the war. These programs
spurred major changes at the
yard. Greater specialization,
for instance, broke up traditional
shops. The biggest
change was in construction
methods, most notably prefabrication.
Several bow and
stern sections, each with its
own keel, were built separately&mdash;many
in the Shipfitters
Shop, but also &ldquo;in playgrounds
and schoolyards and parts of
the yard, and all around greater
Boston,&rdquo; remembered Rigger
Charles Snell. These were then
joined to the midship hull section
rising on the shipways.
&ldquo;Economy was not the name of
the game,&rdquo; recalled Snell. &ldquo;The
name of the game was time.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="interlude">New Careers for Old Ships</h4>
<p>During the long era of wooden
sailing ships, when naval
technology changed only
gradually over the decades, a
warship&rsquo;s service lasted as
long as the materials from
which it was built. But as the
pace of change quickened in
the mid-19th century with the
advent of steam propulsion
and iron hulls, a vessel quickly
grew obsolete without continual
incorporation of the latest
technology. This state of
affairs, which intensified in
the 20th century, provided
Charlestown Navy Yard with a
new role after World War II:
lengthening or transforming
the careers of old ships, otherwise
destined for mothballs,
through modernization
and conversion. Modernization
meant updating old electrical,
propulsion, or weapons
systems or performing structural
surgery without altering
the vessel&rsquo;s function. This
ranged from installing a sonar
dome on the bottom of the
hull to dismantling the
entire superstructure and
building a new one. The process
normally took several
months. Conversion, which
could take years, involved
major alteration of a vessel to
prepare it for a different tactical
mission. A typical example
would be the conversion of a
conventional scouting,
escorting, and submarine-fighting
destroyer to a radar
picket destroyer, whose role
was to provide mid-ocean
radar warning. A notable
postwar task undertaken by
the yard was the 1956 conversion
of the destroyer <i>Gyatt</i>
into the world&rsquo;s first guided
missile destroyer. Basically,
the vessel&rsquo;s aft five-inch guns
were replaced with a twin
missile launcher. But the ship
had to be significantly altered
to perform its new function.
The yard designed automated
systems that first affixed a
booster charge to the missile
and then moved it from the
air-conditioned belowdecks
magazine to the launcher.
The decks and superstructure
had to be reinforced to withstand
the tremendous pressure
and temperature of a
launch. A system of ducts and
blowout plates was installed
to minimize damage and
injury in the event of a premature
explosion. Innovative
retractable fins at midships
helped stabilize the vessel for
firing. With these and other
changes, the yard remade
<i>Gyatt</i> into a sophisticated
missile-firing machine.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/i35.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="377" />
<p class="pcap"><i>In the late 1950s the Navy began installing sonar equipment
in bow domes. Bow domes reduced hull resistance and were less susceptible
to bubble noise. The Charlestown yard, already a leader in sonar technology,
performed a prototype dome installation in 1958. To install a dome, workers first
cut away part of the old bow, then fitted the prefabricated
dome</i> (<a href="#Page_77">next page</a>, on U.S.S. <i>Willis A. Lee</i> in 1961).</p>

<p>The yard offers the visitor a captivating
glimpse into the activities that for nearly
two centuries supported the United States
Navy. Here on the home front, thousands
of civilian workers and navy personnel
built, repaired, and supplied warships
from the majestic sailing vessels of the
early 19th century to the powerful steel
navy of the 20th century. In 1974, the year
of its closing, 30 acres of the historic yard
were set aside for the National Park Service
as a living museum of the Navy&rsquo;s
activities here. The remaining 100 acres
continue to be developed as part of the
revitalization of Boston&rsquo;s waterfront.</p>

<p>Charlestown Navy Yard&rsquo;s buildings reflect the range of
architectural styles employed over its long history. These
structures served a variety of functions within the working
yard, which was home to naval officers and their families
as well as an industrial work place.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1853, the civilian shipyard workers living in
surrounding communities, primarily Charlestown,
assembled each morning to the ringing of the bell atop
the octagonal Muster House. For most of the 19th century, the workers mustered
there three times daily, in the morning at sunrise, at
lunch, and once more in the evening before retiring to
their homes at sunset.</p>

<p>Directing the activities was the shipyard commandant,
who lived with his family and personal staff in the impressive
mansion constructed in 1805. Built on the yard&rsquo;s high ground, the Commandant&rsquo;s
House provided a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the construction and repair activities
going on below.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Ships at Charlestown</h4>
<p>The Navy&rsquo;s oldest commissioned warship, United States Ship <i>Constitution</i> and
the Charlestown Navy Yard share a long history. Constructed in Boston between
1794 and 1797, &ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo; was repaired and supplied here many times during
its active career. U.S.S. <i>Constitution</i> was permanently berthed in Charlestown in
1897 and has since been open to the public for tours. Like all wooden vessels,
<i>Constitution</i> needs constant attention. In the 1920s, a major overhaul was capped
with a nationwide tour. Between 1992 and 1995, <i>Constitution</i> underwent the
most significant restoration to date in the yard&rsquo;s Dry Dock 1. Newly discovered
drawings and descriptions were used to help skilled naval shipwrights restore the
vessel to its original appearance.</p>

<p>The World War II destroyer
U.S.S. <i>Cassin Young</i> (DD-793)
reflects a very different
kind of sea power than does
<i>Constitution</i>. Yet both warships,
constructed 150 years
apart, served much the same
purpose. Like frigates, destroyers
(known as the workhorses
of the modern navy)
are smaller and less powerful
than the heaviest warships,
but they are fast and remarkably
versatile. Boasting five
5-inch guns and made of
steel, <i>Cassin Young</i> was built
on the West Coast in 1943
and took part in major Pacific
engagements, including
the Saipan landing and the
Battle of Leyte Gulf, where
its crew rescued over 100
sailors from the attack on
U.S.S. <i>Princeton</i>.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Exhibits</h4>
<p>Today, exhibits and educational activities help bring alive the navy yard and
Boston&rsquo;s maritime history. At the USS Constitution Museum,
located in the historic Dry Dock 1 Pumphouse and adjacent buildings, hands-on
activities help visitors to appreciate the skills of a 19th-century seaman and get
a sense of his life aboard a sailing warship. Load and fire a replica cannon, try out
a sailor&rsquo;s sleeping quarters, take a turn at the great wheel of a square-rigger, or
command U.S.S. <i>Constitution</i> in battle on a computer screen.</p>
<p>The museum houses the frigate&rsquo;s logs, weapons, documents, charts, journals,
decorative arts, and other items illustrating the epic role of &ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo; in
U.S. history. Skilled craftsmen demonstrate ship model building, while films and
special programs provide greater insight into the ship&rsquo;s story. A museum
store offers other items relating to <i>Constitution&rsquo;s</i> history
and to the nation&rsquo;s maritime heritage.</p>

<p>The National Park Service is indebted to all those persons
who made the production of this book possible. The text
greatly benefited from suggestions by naval architect and
historian John G. Arrison and historian Frederick R.
Black. The primary source for the yard history was the
National Park Service report, <i>The Charlestown Navy Yard
1800-1973</i> (<i>1800-1842</i> by Edwin C. Bearss; <i>1842-1890</i> by
Edwin C. Bearss and Frederick R. Black; <i>1890-1973</i> by
Frederick R. Black). Other important sources were Kenneth
J. Hagan&rsquo;s <i>This People&rsquo;s Navy: The Making of American
Sea Power</i>, 1991; Howard I. Chapelle&rsquo;s <i>The History of
the American Sailing Navy</i>, 1949; and Donald L. Canney&rsquo;s
<i>The Old Steam Navy</i>, 1990. The handbook was produced
by the staff of the Division of Publications, National Park
Service: Susan Barkus, designer; William Gordon, editor;
Nancy Morbeck Haack, cartographer, assisted by the staff
of Boston National Historical Park.</p>

<p><i>For 174 years, the U.S. Naval Shipyard at Boston,
now called Charlestown Navy Yard, played a significant
role in the creation and growth of the U.S. Navy.
By the time it closed in 1974, it had built more than
200 warships and repaired thousands. Historic black
and white photographs, color photos and illustrations,
and detailed diagrams tell the story of evolving technology
and naval policy and how they affected the
fortunes of the yard and its workers.</i></p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
